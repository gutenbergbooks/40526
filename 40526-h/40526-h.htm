<div class="unindent1">"<span class="smcap">Your</span> name is Rhoda," grandmother
said, with the catechism open in her
hand. "Rhoda. Rhoda. It's quite
easy to say."</div>

<p>"Ain't I the little pig that went to
market?" I asked, anxiously, gazing up
from her lap into her eyes, over which
she wore glass things like covers. "And
ain't I Baby Bunting?" I continued,
with the memory of a famous hunt stealing
over me.</p>

<p>"Once you were," grandmother answered,
soberly. "Now you are Rhoda."</p>

<p>I liked to sit in grandmother's lap.
She had such a soft silk lap, and in her
pocket-hole there was a box which held
peppermint drops. She never gave them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
to anybody but just me, when I was
good, and if her arms were thin and
fragile under the soft silk, she knew
how to hold a little girl in a most comfortable
fashion. Her white hair rippled
down low at the sides, concealing her
ears, but her ears were there for I had
run my fingers up to see. She wore a
lovely lace collar, and a breastpin with
a picture on it, and when she walked the
charms on her watch-chain clinked in a
musical way. Grandmother was beautiful,
and every one said that I looked
just like grandmother. That was very
nice, but puzzling, for my hair was
golden, and my eyes were uncovered, and
where grandmother had her wrinkles I
had only a soft pink cheek.</p>

<p>I never sat very long on grandmother's
lap. It was a function that meant catechism
or extreme repentance, and then,
also, I was too popular for one person
to have me always. The family handed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
me around very much like refreshments.
Now I would be with mother, and now
with father, and now with Auntie May,
who did not live at our house, but would
run in on her way to school to pat my
head. They were all so fond of me that
it was quite gratifying.</p>

<p>"Where is Rhoda?" father would ask
the very first thing when he came into
the house at night, and I would sit up
for him, holding on tightly to my chair
for fear that they would put me to bed
before he came.</p>

<p>Then we would have a little talk together,
up in a corner by ourselves. He
was my confidant, and was more on a
level with me than other people. I had
an idea that he would give me anything,
quite irrespective of goodness or badness,
for when I was naughty he never
appeared to think any the worse of me,
although the rest of the family might
be bowed down with the sense of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
moral shortcomings. He was my champion,
and in the early twilight I had
many stories to tell him, not always of
the strictest veracity.</p>

<p>"And so I runned away, far, far
away, and I only came home just now,"
I invented, in an airy manner.</p>

<p>"Did you see any one on the road?"
he asked, with sudden interest.</p>

<p>He was aware of my love of a romance.</p>

<p>"There was a little old woman in a
red cloak with a red pepper in her
mouth," I answered, peeping up in his
face with wide, truthful eyes.</p>

<p>"Mother Hubbard!" my father cried,
clapping his hands like a boy. "Mother
Hubbard! But where was her dog?"</p>

<p>"Her dog was behind, and he had a
red pepper in his mouth," I added,
hastily.</p>

<p>"I wonder what they were going to
do with them," my father said, luring
me on.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't you know, father?" I cried,
delighted.</p>

<p>"No, I can't think."</p>

<p>"Pies! She was going to make pies
out of them! Pretty red pepper pies!"</p>

<p>"Sure enough!" my father said, much
surprised. "I never thought of that.
How I wish that I'd been along!"</p>

<p>The little old lady in the silk dress
used to quake when I said these things.
That was one of the reasons why she
was teaching me my catechism at such
an early age, and I could repeat some
pretty hymns, too, which helped to comfort
her. Always, no matter how extravagant
the tale might be, she made
her protest. She meant that, at least,
there should be one strong hand to guide
the child on the right road.</p>

<p>"That is not really so, Rhoda," she
declared, in a severe voice. "You did
not see an old woman with a red pepper
in her mouth."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>I looked at her with a pout.</p>

<p>"Well, I did see an old woman in a
red cloak, grandma."</p>

<p>"No, you didn't see an old woman
at all. Child, you have not been out of
the house to-day!"</p>

<p>"I saw a dog with a red pepper in
his mouth," I said, meekly.</p>

<p>"No, you did not even see a dog."</p>

<p>"Well, I saw my own red pepper!"
I cried, breaking into sudden tears, for
this was my last stronghold, and if the
pepper was taken away all my charming
fairy tale was gone.</p>

<p>"It's not a question of truth or untruth,"
my father said, tossing his head
back as if he were displeased. "It was
merely a story of adventure. Pray did
you never meet any heroic beasts yourself
in your own day?"</p>

<p>I opened one wet eye, and stole a
cautious glance at grandmother.</p>

<p>"Never, Robert, never!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>I began to cry again harder than
before.</p>

<p>Then my father took me in his
arms, and carried me upstairs to my
mother.</p>

<p>"Grandmother has been making her
tell the truth," he said, ruefully. "She
hasn't any sympathy with Rhoda's
imagination."</p>

<p>So even in those early days I found
that I had an imagination, just as I had
a chair with long legs, and a blue plate,
and a silver mug. It was a sleeping
imagination as yet, for though I had a
beautiful blue plate with a blue bridge
over a blue and white stream, I never
imagined until after years that those
tiny figures on the bridge were lovers
running away from a cruel parent.
Then the bridge was the spot beyond
which the gravy must not flow. When
it swept over the boundary which I
marked for it, I pounded the table with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
impotent rage, and would eat no more
dinner.</p>

<p>"If she were a child of mine," grandmother
said, sternly, "she should eat
her dinner. It is simply preposterous
that her temper should be allowed to go
unchecked. What will she be when she
grows up!"</p>

<p>"I don't think that Rhoda has a bad
temper," my mother replied, plaintively.
"It's only that she's the soul of order."</p>

<p>My mother always discovered an excuse
that fitted my case, and that critical
grandparent of mine found the
ground swept from beneath her feet.
I was the soul of order. She had seen
me herself with my large basketful of
toys wending wearily about the house.
It was a large basket, a beautiful yellow
one with a red handle, and when
I began to play my things came out
of it, and when I was through playing
they went into the yellow basket again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
I had a rag doll of a pleasing appearance,
named Arabella, and a black
woolly creature, which to the eye of affection
was a dog, and some of the small
bits of carved wood with which a wooden
Noah intended to replenish his earth. I
played the most delightful games with
these toys, and my mother played with
me like another small child.</p>

<p>It was with her that I lived most of
my life. We were together, not only
during the day, but also at night, for
when I woke up hours after I had been
put in my crib, she was always sitting
in the lamplight, sewing or reading, or
else quietly watching the fire on the
hearth. There was a cheerful glitter
from the brass andirons and fender, and
on a shelf above a silver candle-stick
with crystal pendants threw out rosy
lights. I did not know any of these
wonderful things by name, but I vaguely
enjoyed their engaging sparkle, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
would lie feeling very safe and warm,
with my eyes on the central figure which
came and went, now large and mother-like,
now lost in the misty depths of
slumber.</p>

<p>Strong as was my feeling of proprietorship
in that crib, however, there came
a dreadful night when I awoke to find
myself lost. I was in a new bed. I
was in grandmother's big bed, where
there was a faint smell of lavender which
I liked without knowing why. Grandmother
herself had me in her arms and
was soothing me.</p>

<p>"Hush-a-by, baby," she said, in quite
a new tone, somewhat like a grandmother,
but more like an angel. "Hush-a-by,
baby, in the treetop."</p>

<p>I sat up and looked about for the
shining fender. It was gone! The fire
was gone, and my mother was gone!</p>

<p>"I want my mother," I said, sternly.</p>

<p>"Rhoda can't have mother now.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Rhoda must stay with grandma," the
dulcet voice went on. "Grandma's own
little Rhoda!"</p>

<p>"But I want my mother," I cried, all
the sternness breaking into sobs.</p>

<p>Grandmother was evidently alarmed.
She rocked me softly, she gave me hurried
sips of water, and, at last, she
emptied the peppermint drops, not one
by one as heretofore, but, lavishly, in
dozens, into my hand. I felt a little
more comfortable. The fender was a
pretty thing to watch, but peppermint
drops were peppermint drops. I went
to sleep in my grandmother's arms quite
calmly, while with tender touches she
dried my eyes and smoothed my hair.</p>

<p>"Bless the child!" I heard her say, in
the pause between dreams.</p>

<p>It was rather a shock, perhaps, to
wake up in that big bed next morning
and be dressed by grandmother. She
was very awkward at it, as if she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
forgotten how small garments were constructed,
and how hard it was for arms
to go into sleeves. I was preternaturally
good, but even when I slipped my
hand into hers to go downstairs I was
meaning to desert her when mother came
into sight.</p>

<p>We went down to breakfast, very
clean and neat, with short, sober steps
that suited both our gaits. Father came
hurrying to meet us and was quite overjoyed
to see me; but, although I searched
in all the closets and behind the doors,
there was no mother in any of the
rooms. When no one was looking at
me I started upstairs to hunt for her.
Grandmother called me back in that old
tone which must be obeyed, which had
the ring of authority and catechism in it.</p>

<p>"Stay here, Rhoda," she said, decisively.
"You are not to go out of this
room."</p>

<p>Then with cautious steps she mounted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
up herself, passing into the forbidden
regions, and father and I were all that
were left of the circle about the table,
which was usually so gay with talk and
merriment. To my eyes father had a
look as if he, too, were frightened.</p>

<p>"Never mind, father," I said, eagerly.
"Rhoda won't run away."</p>

<p>He took me up with rather an apologetic
laugh.</p>

<p>"Little daughter," he said, in a tender
way, "did I ever tell you about the big
bird?"</p>

<p>"No, father," I answered, quickly.</p>

<p>"Not about the time when it brought
me Rhoda?"</p>

<p>I stared at him with delighted eyes.
Evidently I was going to hear something
of great importance, something
which concerned me alone.</p>

<p>"Three years ago," my father began,
in an easy fashion, "I thought I'd like
a little daughter. So I sent a letter to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
a beautiful big bird which lives far away
where the blue sky comes down to the
ground. The bird has lots of little
babies&mdash;girl babies and boy babies&mdash;on
the shore of a lake where the sun
shines day and night. She's a very
good-natured bird, and sometimes when
she hears of a father who's lonely because
he hasn't any children, she'll put
a little baby under her wing, and fly
on over the beautiful country until she
comes to its father's house. Now the
bird knew that I was very lonely, because
I had sent her a letter, so one
day she picked up little Rhoda out of
a lily leaf, and came flying along&mdash;flying
along&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I remember! I remember!" I cried,
clapping my hands. "She put me under
her wing, and the feathers did tickle
so!"</p>

<p>My father stopped to laugh; but in
a moment he continued his narrative.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"She came flying along straight into
the garden where I was walking about.
She put you down&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you said, 'Is this my little
Rhoda?' and I said, 'Yes, father!'"</p>

<p>"Just so."</p>

<p>"Now tell it all over again, father,"
I demanded in delight.</p>

<p>My father laughed and hugged me
closer. He still had that apologetic look
on his face, and if I had been a little
older and a little wiser, I would have
known that my father was trying very
hard to break something to me.</p>

<p>"She has a great many babies," he
said at last, in an uneasy tone. "More
than she knows what to do with. Yesterday
I wrote her to send me another
Rhoda."</p>

<p>I drew away from him, dumbfounded.</p>

<p>"Another Rhoda!" I exclaimed, with
a gasp, frowning at him.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you like a little sister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
to play with?" he inquired, tenderly.
"To sleep with you in your crib? And
sit by you at the table?"</p>

<p>"No, father."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes, you would, Rhoda!"</p>

<p>"No, no, no!" I screamed, breaking
into angry tears.</p>

<p>He tried to comfort me in a blundering,
laughing manner, but in the midst
of all my sorrow grandmother's voice
called to him from above.</p>

<p>"Robert!"</p>

<p>When the room cleared before my
eyes I saw that I was alone.</p>

<p>At that same moment I had decided
on my course of action. Very quickly,
very quietly, I collected my plate and
mug, my woolly dog and pleasant faced
doll, and the yellow basket with the red
handle, and stowed them all away in a
dark corner under the sofa, where they
were hidden from sight. My blue hood
which hung in the hall, and was something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
quite new and precious, I put on
my head, where it would be safest.
Then half terrified, half defiant, I took
up my position at the window to watch
for the arrival of that other self which
would dispute my realm. Every second
I dreaded to hear the flutter of wings
as the bird passed over the house, and
to see another Rhoda standing expectant
in the garden, to see my father,
perhaps, hurrying to meet her with
outstretched arms. It was a terrible
hour.</p>

<p>In my need, however, I found a new
friend, Norah from out the kitchen. I
had known her before, as a person owning
unlimited cake, and apt to display
a strong liking for myself, but then she
had been only an outsider, while now
she was almost nearer to me than my
mother. I threw myself straight into
her willing arms, and told my story.</p>

<p>Norah was evidently astonished, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
almost incredulous. She did not believe
that there could be another Rhoda. She
had never heard of any bird, but when I
persisted she shared my views, and entered
into my position with great partisanship.</p>

<p>"But, sure, I'd not worrit my mind,"
Norah said, consolingly. "No burrd in
her sinses would take a baby out in such
weather as this."</p>

<p>To be sure it was raining. I had not
thought of that before. A fierce storm
was beating against the house, and pools
of water stood under the trees. The raindrops
on the window pane ran down in
small rivulets, and splashed against the
sill just as my tears had done before.</p>

<p>"She'll get her feathers all wet," I
cried, triumphantly.</p>

<p>"And she'll not dry them at my
kitchen fire!" Norah declared, with stupendous
daring.</p>

<p>We were out in the kitchen now. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
was a very pleasant homely place. A
kettle sang on the stove, and a cat purred
on the hearth, and the carpet had beautiful
red stripes that seemed too pretty
to walk on. Norah was very good to
me. She had my high-chair ranged at
the side of the hearth, and the cat, under
compulsion, sat on my lap, and they all
sang,&mdash;the kettle, the cat, and Norah,
in their several fashions, as if they were
happy. They acted very much as if
they were entertaining royalty.</p>

<p>If it had not been for my sorrow I
should have enjoyed myself, but the
thought of that bird would pass across
my mind. She had come once when she
was sent for, bearing me from my lily
leaf to my own home. The rain might
fall, and the day might be very dark,
but who was to know if that conscientious
bird would not still fulfill her mission?
Why, there were five children in
the next house, and the bird must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
brought them all! When the bell rang,
as it rang many times in the course of
the day, I would creep to the kitchen
door to listen, and feel greatly relieved
when I found that it was only men and
women who wanted to come in.</p>

<p>"It was no burrd," Norah would say,
reporting on each occasion.</p>

<p>"Did you lock the door?" I asked,
anxiously.</p>

<p>"I did that. There's no burrd shall
make her way into this house to-day,"
she answered, with a great show of
determination.</p>

<p>Even as she spoke there came a faint
strange sound from upstairs, a wailing
cry, as though something very weak was
angry and frightened, and wanted matters
arranged to suit its own will and
convenience. For one moment I thought
Norah heard the sound, too. She seemed
to smile; but on the instant she broke
into a queer, elfish song, and began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
dance before the fire in an irresistible
way that brought me capering beside
her in a burst of glee. The bird had
passed out of my mind, and I was
Rhoda again, the little queen of the
household, to whom all deferred, even
grandmother in her tenderer moments.</p>

<p>It was very late that afternoon when
I heard my father calling to me in an
eager, excited manner. He came out
into the kitchen where I and the cat
were both in Norah's lap, indistinguishable
in the growing darkness.</p>

<p>"Where is Rhoda?" he cried. "Where
is my little daughter? I've got something
to show her."</p>

<p>I went to him quickly. It was nice
to have him back again, and to be kissed
in the old fond way. He threw me upon
his shoulder and started off; but even
as we stepped into the hall he called
back to Norah, still with that boyish
eagerness in his voice.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"You can come, too, Norah," he said,
generously. "I want you to see what
we've got upstairs."</p>

<p>Norah joined us without comment,
and followed behind through the hall
and upstairs into mother's room. There
it was very dark, for the curtains were
drawn, and the only light came from the
fire on the hearth, in front of which
grandmother was sitting. She sat in a
new majestic style, and on her lap there
was something bundled up which she
patted from time to time, and she
trotted her feet in a funny seasaw
fashion. When she saw us come in she
smiled, and then very slowly she folded
down a covering, and showed us a pillow,
and on the pillow there were two
little babies' heads.</p>

<p>"Twins!" Norah cried, and threw up
her arms in the air. "Now the saints
be good to us," she said, piously.</p>

<p>"S-s-sh&mdash;Not so loud, Norah,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
grandmother whispered, in rebuke, and
trotted her feet a little harder.</p>

<p>"Let Rhoda see," father exclaimed.
"Let Rhoda come quite close."</p>

<p>I went up closer by grandmother's
knee and looked at them. It was a
new experience, and for a moment I felt
sorry for myself. Those about me must
have shared the feeling, for their eyes
grew kinder, and father patted my back,
and Norah muttered under her breath.</p>

<p>"Sure it's a come down in the world,"
I heard her say, pityingly.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, those two little creatures
half opened their eyes, and gazed
at me. They smiled at me! They knew
that I was their big sister! Oh, the
wonder of the two little heads on the
pillow, the mystery of the eyes that
looked at me so placidly, with that smile
of kinship in their depths! I forgot
the bird, I forgot my jealousy. I was
ready to give them anything, anything,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
even the woolly dog and the yellow
basket with the red handle, for the
simple honor of their acquaintanceship.
They were so young, and they were so
weak! They could not walk, and they
could not talk. They had everything to
learn. I felt very old beside them, although
I did not know that in that first
moment when grandmother turned the
covering down I had become the eldest
child.</p>

<p>"Oh, grandma," I cried, radiantly,
"you may have one, but the other one
shall belong all to me!"</p>

<p>There was a movement in the bed,
and some one called to me. I ran into
the darkness and found my mother.
There on the pillow beside her pretty
dark hair she made a place for me, where
we could see each other's eyes. Her arm
was about me in a protecting way, as
if she knew how hard the world had
become for me.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>"Rhoda," she said, with that smile
which always seemed so wise, "mother's
heart is a big, big place! There is room
in it both for dear little Rhoda and the
dear little babies."</p>

<p>I felt that I was content.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>LILY-ANN</div>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<div class="unindent1">"<span class="smcap">This</span> is Lily-Ann, Rhoda," my mother
said, in an introductory tone. "She is
to be your little nurse, and play with
you. Do you know many nice games,
Lily-Ann?"</div>

<p>From the shelter of my mother's chair
I stared at the new-comer. I almost
thought at first that it might be a little
girl, until I noticed the shining folds
of white apron. Lily-Ann was all white
apron, down to the tops of her large,
patched shoes. She was fourteen years
old, perhaps, with the dignity of forty.
She had a wide, smiling face, and
appeared to be very agreeable in manner,
so when she put out her hand I slipped
mine cordially into it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can play at wild beasts, and puss-in-the-corner,
and 'ride a cock horse to Banbury
Cross,'" she told my mother over my
head. "I am experienced. I have helped
to raise three children, ma'am."</p>

<p>She looked so small as she ended in
this impressive fashion that my mother
laughed, and my grandmother gleamed
responsively through her glasses.</p>

<p>"It must be only quiet games, mind,"
my mother said. "You mustn't teach
Miss Rhoda to be noisy."</p>

<p>Lily-Ann promised to observe this
caution faithfully, and I suppose she
thought that they were only quiet games
which we played that morning. We
had all three,&mdash;Banbury Cross, then
puss-in-the-corner, and, finally, wild
beasts. Lily-Ann crawled under the
bed and roared at me, now like a tiger,
now plaintively, like a big pussy cat,
and again with a deeper note that carried
menace in its tone.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's a lion," she explained, in
between great volumes of sound. "Lions
eat people all up. So do wolves. Now
I'm a wolf. Hear me crunch their
bones!"</p>

<p>There was a horrible snarl under the
bed, and something white and shining
made a snatch at my foot, and then
retreated, to return the next moment in
a panting rush, much too real to be
pleasant.</p>

<p>"Oh, please, Lily-Ann, I don't want
to play wild beasts any more!" I exclaimed,
half afraid; but only half
afraid, for she was very obedient to my
whims, and, when I cried loud enough,
came out in a crushed state to be a
little girl again.</p>

<p>At first I liked Lily-Ann. She was
so companionable, and then she knew
such quantities of strange things. For
instance, it was she who showed me how
to make my hair curl. It could be done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
by eating crusts! There had always been
a great deal of trouble about my crusts.
I would never eat them, not even after
I had been reminded of all the poor children
in the world who had not a crust
apiece to stay their hunger on, and whom
it seemed that I should benefit in some
marvelous way by eating mine.</p>

<p>"They can have these," I replied, generously,
to such appeals to my feelings.
"I'll save them for them every day."</p>

<p>That, however, was before Lily-Ann
came, and I learned that a crusty diet
was warranted to make the hair curl.
To think that little Rhoda Harcourt
might have curly hair! What a nice
thing that would be! Of course it
meant months of work, but Lily-Ann,
whose hair twisted from the roots, must
surely know. Under her encouragement
I ate all my own crusts, and begged so
earnestly for more at the table that I
became a wonder to the family.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is the curl coming, Lily-Ann?" I
would ask, eagerly, in the mornings
when she stood over me, comb in hand.</p>

<p>"It's coming more and more every
day," she asserted, to my great satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Ouch! How you do hurt, Lily-Ann!"</p>

<p>"That's because it's so curly. See
that long, beautiful one. I can't hardly
get my comb through!"</p>

<p>I sighed blissfully with my eyes full
of tears, and wondered when my mother
would notice the change in her little
girl, for, indeed, something must have
happened to my hair, judging from the
jerks.</p>

<p>It was Lily-Ann again who taught
me how to catch sparrows by throwing
salt on their tails. I ran about very
hot and eager all one morning, and
ended by feeling rather foolish, for not
a bird would be caught, though I crept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
persistently on their track, always sure
that the next time I should be successful.
Still, I did not bear any grudge
against Lily-Ann. It was not her fault
that I was unfortunate, and then, too,
she was very sympathetic.</p>

<p>"Why, my cousin caught one only
yesterday!" she cried, in astonishment.
"But then she is older than you are.
And so smart! She turned a horsehair
into a snake once. Did you ever do
that, ma'am?"</p>

<p>"No," I answered, doubtfully; and
immediately added, with growing enthusiasm,
"oh, I should so like to do
that!"</p>

<p>The end of it was that a faint suspicion
which had crept upon me after
the sparrow episode was quenched in
the zeal with which I set myself to the
awful task of raising snakes by the
wholesale. There was always a touch
of dread in the eagerness with which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
visited the snake incubator,&mdash;a rusty
pan half-filled with water, and hidden
in a secret space behind the lilac bush.
Little by little the horror of the situation
so overcame me that I hurriedly
weeded the horsehairs out; but the six
that remained were the finest and longest
which I could find, destined, I could
easily expect from their size, to become
boa-constrictors.</p>

<p>I believed everything that Lily-Ann
told me. Up to that time there had
never been occasion for me to question
any one's truth, nor had there been anything
of which to be afraid. Now I
learned of a new world that lay about
me,&mdash;the Land of the Dark,&mdash;in which
familiar furniture played wild pranks,
and shadows came to have a very terrible
meaning.</p>

<p>"After you go to bed at night," Lily-Ann
said, impressively, holding up a fat
forefinger, "there are Things that come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
out and run all about the floor! Under
the chairs and under the bed they creep
around. Especially under the bed. If
you should let your hand hang down, a
Thing would take it and shake it!"</p>

<p>I peered at her from out the shelter
of the bed-clothes, for I was in bed
when this was first related, and she was
sitting by me until I should go to sleep.</p>

<p>"I shall never do that, Lily-Ann," I
said, faintly, gluing my arms closer to
my sides.</p>

<p>"You might in your sleep," she returned,
with grim significance.</p>

<p>"And that ain't all," she went on, after
a short but terrible pause. "There's a
Bear in the garret. He wants something."</p>

<p>"What does he want?" I asked, fearfully,
determined to know the worst at
once.</p>

<p>"He wants a bad child. He's hungry!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Now I was bad, as I had just reason
to know. Lily-Ann used to examine
my record every night, and she was the
greatest one that I have ever seen for
pointing out flaws in character.</p>

<p>"I don't think I've been <i>very</i> bad
to-day, Lily-Ann," I said, trembling.</p>

<p>"You took your little brother's ball,"
she answered, shortly.</p>

<p>"But I gave it back to him!" I cried,
aghast.</p>

<p>"You slapped your little sister."</p>

<p>"But she slapped me, too!" I pleaded.</p>

<p>"Not until after you slapped her.
And you are six years old."</p>

<p>That was one of the unkindest things
about Lily-Ann; she was always trying
to make me live up to my station. And
it was so hard to be good, and hardest
of all to be good enough for my great
age. That night, however, I made a
compact with her.</p>

<p>"Dear Lily-Ann," I said, piteously,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
"if I go right to sleep by myself, so
you can get your supper, will you chase
away the Things and tell the Bear that
there is no bad child in this house?"</p>

<p>I was not prone to criticise my elders
and betters; but somehow I had remarked
that Lily-Ann was fond of her
supper.</p>

<p>She went away without much urging,
and I lay there miserably in the dark.
It seemed to me that there was a stir
all through the quiet room, and out in
the hall the garret door creaked in a
new manner. The dark was so much
blacker than it had ever been before,
and even when I went down head and
all under the covers I could hear the
Things pattering about the floor, and
the Bear rattling at the knob. Many
a night after that I huddled myself up
into a heap, afraid to sleep lest my
hands should unclasp and slip out of
bed, afraid to move lest the Bear on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the prowl for bad children should
pounce on me and eat me up, sins and
all. I used to pretend to sleep very
loudly and heavily that he might think
me a good child. Still, I felt that it
must be hard to deceive a Bear, and that
sooner or later he would make an end
of me. As for the Things, I never had
any hope of getting the better of them.
All through the long nights they slipped
and slid about, or stood waiting at the
edge of the bed to shake hands, with a
friendliness that was truly awful.</p>

<p>Even in my greatest fear, however, I
never betrayed Lily-Ann. I was too
much in her power to dare to tell tales
about her. I used to marvel when the
family commented on her faithfulness,
or devised schemes for improving the
home from which she had come. Many
large bundles went out of our house,
and I often heard my mother speaking
in a sympathetic fashion of the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
girl whose childhood was passed in the
service of others.</p>

<p>"Poor Lily-Ann, she's never had any
childhood of her own," she would say,
regretfully.</p>

<p>Out in the kitchen, too, I had heard
our Norah exchanging confidences on
the subject with her cousin, who came
in sometimes, when there was company,
to help with the work.</p>

<p>"I give her all the cold things to
take home every night," Norah confided.
"The praties and bits of mate;
just anything. They are that starving
that they are not particular. Every
smithereen of clothes that she has the mistress
gave her, and the old lady has been
open-handed, too. There's many a ten-dollar
bill finds its way to that house."</p>

<p>The cousin sniffed.</p>

<p>"The rest of us have to work for
our own," she said. "Faith, it's fine
to be reckless sometimes."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I'm not trusting her," Norah
continued, darkly. "She tells lies.
And she's cross to my child!"</p>

<p>"Who is your child, Norah?" I
asked, with sudden eagerness, pressing
up close to her gingham apron.</p>

<p>Norah lifted me upon her capacious
lap and patted my back.</p>

<p>"And it's herself that wants to
know," she cried, with a rallying laugh.
"See that now! Ain't she growing a
big girl, Bridget? See the praties in
her cheeks! Sure, she's purty enough
to be Irish."</p>

<p>"But who is your child, Norah?" I
persisted, jealously; and it was only
when a burst of laughter broke from
the two women that I understood, and
hid my face in the concealing folds of
the gingham apron.</p>

<p>I was very good to Lily-Ann after
this time. Not that I had ever been
bad to her before; but now I began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
join in the work of charity. I made her
a present of the little gold locket which
my grandmother Lawrence gave me on
my last birthday, and of my second-best
pair of shoes, which had been red once,
and still retained a delightful color. I
wanted to give her my Sunday cloak,
also, but she reminded me that there
were other Sundays yet to come. She
did take my bank with its one jingling
gold coin in it. Unfortunately, all the
money of less value had been pried out
long ago to buy candy, but I told Lily-Ann
how sorry I was that the little red
house was not filled to the chimney with
pennies. I promised that I would give
her all my money in the future to take
home to her family, so that they might
never be hungry again. Lily-Ann heard
me in silence. She did not thank me
with her lips, but when the Things grew
too rampant at night she would reprove
them sometimes in a stern manner.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go away!" she would cry, stamping
her foot energetically. "Rhoda is
a good child."</p>

<p>The Things and the Bear all grunted
with the same voice as they retreated in
discontent to their lairs; but I was not
critical. It was enough for me that they
went, if only for a time. Always I remembered
that Lily-Ann could summon
them at will, and her importance grew
greater day by day.</p>

<p>There were hours, however, when I
escaped into the safety of my mother's
room. I was not too small to understand
the delights of that cheerful room,&mdash;the
glittering objects on the dressing-table,
the deep bureau drawers filled
with wonders much too dainty for a
child to touch. There were keepsakes,
also, mementos of my mother's childhood
and youth; prize books in foreign
tongues, won at school and laid away
in tissue paper; bits of costly lace, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
many little worthless, well-beloved possessions.
In the closet there was a box
on an upper shelf. Quite an ordinary
box it was on the outside, made of
pasteboard and tied with bands of yellow
ribbon which had once been white.
My mother lifted the cover one day,
and showed me what was inside. It
was the most wonderful thing, and it
had come off her wedding-cake. There
was a white platform surrounded with a
wreath of white roses and leaves, and in the
center of the platform there stood under a
wreathed arch two little dolls, arm in arm.</p>

<p>"They are going to be married," my
mother said. "They came off the top
of my cake when I was married."</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't it too sweet for anything!"
I cried, in an ecstasy. "But,
mother, why does the lady doll wear a
veil?"</p>

<p>"All brides do. You shall, too, some
day."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"Shall I?" I questioned, doubtfully.
"But, mother, dear, suppose I should
grow up, and never get married, won't
you give me these little dolls to play
with?"</p>

<p>"If that should happen I suppose I
must," my mother said, with a laugh,
and tied the box up tightly again, and
put it back on the upper shelf.</p>

<p>I dreamed about that box. I talked
of it to Lily-Ann, and described the
enchanting veil at great length; and I
even condescended to tell the twins
about the dolls that mother had. Once,
with great pain from the acute rasping
of my knees, I climbed up the closet
shelves, and peeked in a loose corner of
the box. Then I came down again,
perfectly satisfied, for the dolls were
still there, and if I escaped marriage
they were to be my own. I determined
that I would never marry. It would
be at too great a cost.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon after this there came a day when
everything seemed to go wrong. Lily-Ann
was very cross, while my mother
looked sad and even frightened. She
went up and down stairs many times.
She watched me furtively, and asked
whispered questions of Lily-Ann. I
wondered what Lily-Ann could possibly
be telling her. I knew that it was
not about me, for I had been very good
that afternoon. To be sure, I had
pulled the cat's tail; but she and I had
kissed each other affectionately afterwards,
and were friends again. Nor
was Lily-Ann apt to reveal my misdeeds.
She liked to judge me herself
in that dread hour when the dark
brought repentance. Still, as the questions
went on and on, I was sure that
I heard my name, not once but many
times, now from Lily-Ann, and now
from my mother, with a gasp of
dismay.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Then my mother took me in her arms
and kissed me, and rocked me as if I
were a baby again, and in the middle
of it all made me a little confidence.</p>

<p>"Rhoda, mother always meant to give
you those little dolls," she said.</p>

<p>"Oh, did you, mother!" I cried,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"But giving is different from taking.
Do you know what it means to steal a
thing, Rhoda?"</p>

<p>I nodded solemnly.</p>

<p>"'Thou shalt not steal,' you know the
Bible says."</p>

<p>"Yes, mother."</p>

<p>"Did you climb up into my closet one
day?"</p>

<p>I hung my head.</p>

<p>"Rhoda, when you knew that you
had only to ask for mother to give them
to you, why did you take away my little
dolls?"</p>

<p>"But I did not take them," I cried,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
in surprise. "I only looked at them.
Was I very bad, mother?"</p>

<p>"You didn't take them? Think what
you are saying, Rhoda."</p>

<p>"I did not take them," I protested,
breaking into tears, for though I was
bad, I knew that I was not that bad.</p>

<p>I could see that she did not believe me.
She sighed in a way that I had never
heard my mother sigh before, and set me
down on the floor beside her. Then she
took me by the hand, and we made a
very solemn pilgrimage up the stairs,
and through her room into the one which
was my own, straight up into the corner
where my doll-house stood. She opened
the little door, and motioned me to look
in. The bride and groom were leaning
stiffly side by side against the sofa in the
parlor! They stared back at me with
scorn on their sugar faces, and there was,
also, something accusing in their expression,
as if they were saying, "Little girl,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
how do we come here?" Still I would
not confess. I had not taken them. I
had wanted them very much, but now I
did not want them at all. I should have
liked to smash their sugar heads, for it
was their fault. They had done it themselves,
stepping down from their high
shelf in the middle of the night. They
were tired of living tied up in a box, and
wanted my doll-house to set up housekeeping
in. They had done it themselves
just to plague me. There was no
other way to explain it.</p>

<p>"What does she say?" grandmother
asked, creeping in behind us.</p>

<p>"Not the truth!" my mother cried.
"I should never have suspected my child
of lying and stealing! But Lily-Ann
says it is not the first time!"</p>

<p>I stood and looked at them. It almost
seemed as if I did not love them any
more. They knew me so little that they
thought I could steal those sugar dolls.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"Grandma, put her to bed for me,"
my mother said, still with that frightened
look on her face. "I don't know
what to say to her. I must ask her
father."</p>

<p>Grandmother put me to bed, with
slow, patient fingers. She tucked me in,
and kissed me in quite a tender way.</p>

<p>"Tell grandma," she urged, in a
whisper, bending down until her spectacles
touched my hot cheek.</p>

<p>But still I would not confess.</p>

<p>It was very quiet in my little room
after she had gone. I could hear the
dishes rattling down-stairs, as Norah
set the table with a bang of the plates
and a thump of the knives. We were
going to have honey for supper and
little cakes with frosted tops baked
in scolloped patty-pans. I wondered
whether I should have any supper, or
must lie there in the dark, while they
talked about me at the supper-table.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
I did not think that <i>I</i> could enjoy
frosted cake baked in scolloped patty-pans
if <i>my</i> little girl were alone up-stairs
in the dark. When I grew up and married,
for I might as well marry now, I
would never treat any one so. Never!
Never!! Never!!!</p>

<p>"Oh, please, God, let me hurry and
grow up," I whispered to the darkness.
"And, oh, please, God, let me have
frosted cake for my supper!"</p>

<p>I waited for the prayer to bear fruit.
Sometimes prayers were rather slow. I
heard my father come home with a cheerful
rustle of parcels. He hung up his
coat and hat in the hall, and tiptoed upstairs
to wash his hands. He knew that
the twins were asleep in their cribs; but
he did not know that I was beyond in the
darkness, afraid to speak to him. He
did not miss me, although I was always
the first to welcome him at the door.
Nobody seemed to miss me. I heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
them draw up their chairs to the table.
Now they were eating honey. Now
they were eating frosted cake. Lily-Ann
would have some of the cake.
They believed in her. It was only their
own little girl whom they sent to bed
without her supper. It was only Rhoda
whom nobody loved. If God would
let me grow up quick, I would go away
and not be a trouble to them any more.
Perhaps off in the country I might find
somebody who would love me, and believe
in me, for I did not want to be
loved unless I was believed in. I should
be very lonely at first, nearly as lonely
as I was now. A sore place came in
my throat that made me cry because it
hurt so.</p>

<p>The kitchen door opened in the distance,
and a whirlwind swept into the
dining-room. There was a pause, punctuated
by loud remarks delivered in a
high Irish voice, and then the whirlwind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
came up the stairs, and swept me
out of my bed. It was Norah. I clung
to her, for she was the only thing which
I had left to love in the whole world.
My father and mother had deserted me,
but Norah was staunch. She kissed me
as she carried me, big girl as I was,
straight down the steps into the dazzling
light of the supper-table. Norah
was excited. She had a red spot on
each cheek, and her eyes shone like
stars. She held me tightly with one
arm and gesticulated with the other.
Against the white panel of the kitchen
door Lily-Ann was crouched in a timid,
frightened fashion, with all the spirit
gone out of her wide face, and almost
the very curl gone out of her hair.</p>

<p>"She had them dolls yisterday,"
Norah cried, accusingly, her finger
pointed straight at the kitchen door.
"I saw them in her box. Sure, I
thought that the mistress gave them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
her, and it's not for the likes of me to
say what the mistress shall give or not
give. Then this morning when there
was questions asked, she crept upstairs
and put them in the doll-house. The
sarpent! Is my child to lie in the dark
crying her heart out, and that sarpent
set at my kitchen-table drinking her
tay, and telling me wicked tales of my
child?"</p>

<p>Nobody answered her. They stared
at her in bewilderment. Norah had
never acted like that before.</p>

<p>"If there was questions to be asked,
why wasn't I asked?" she went on,
angrily. "If the mistress or the master
had said to me, 'Norah, where's them
little dolls?' I would have told them the
truth. I would have said, 'Lily-Ann
stole them yisterday, ma'am, and to-day
she put them in the doll-house, sur.'
But, no, they don't ask honest old
Norah. They listen to that sarpent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
backbiting my child. The little innocent
creatur! The dear little old-fashioned
thing that niver took nought
from nobody!"</p>

<p>I put my arms around Norah's neck,
and hugged her until I nearly strangled
her.</p>

<p>"Give Rhoda to me, Norah," my
mother said, jealously.</p>

<p>"There's only one thing more to be
said, ma'am," Norah continued, obstinately
standing her ground, still with
my arms about her neck. "Either old
Norah goes or that sarpent goes. I'll
have no sarpents in my kitchen."</p>

<p>They were all looking at Lily-Ann
now. There was a ring of truth about
Norah's story which had convinced them
at last.</p>

<p>"Have you anything to say, Lily-Ann?"
my father asked, sternly.</p>

<p>She had nothing to say. As she
drooped a little closer to the door and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
wiped her eyes in a miserable fashion,
I felt that I could forgive her all the
harm which she had done me. Poor
Lily-Ann, who my mother said had
never been a child!</p>

<p>"Oh, please, Norah, let Lily-Ann
stay!" I cried, piteously. "I'll be so
good if you'll let Lily-Ann stay!"</p>

<p>Norah might, perhaps, have been
softened by my appeal, but my father
would not listen. The words which he
used were very stern ones, and his was
the hand that held open the door for
Lily-Ann to pass out of the house.
She went slowly, almost regretfully, as
though at the last she felt repentance.
I never saw her again.</p>

<p>It was many a long year, however,
before I cast off her evil spell. Even
in the illnesses of my maturer years
those crawling Things have come back,
passing across the mirror of a pain-racked
mind with all the horror of childish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
ignorance and fear. Yet I still feel
that I have forgiven Lily-Ann. Coming
from the home that she did, and
unwatched and unsuspected as she was,
she might easily have destroyed the
holy innocence of a child's life. But
she left me as she found me.</p>

<p>I went upstairs very quietly that
night. There was a candle burning
on the bedroom table, and something
which my prayer had brought, something
frosted, with scolloped edges, was
tucked under my pillow. The whole
family came to put me to bed, and
made so much of me that I glowed
under their affection.</p>

<p>"She will forget it all in time," my
father said, tenderly, unwitting of my
long memory. "Evil dies away quickly
from a child's mind."</p>

<p>My mother was more impulsive. She
went down on her knees and put her
arms about me.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"Forgive mother," she whispered, with
her mouth against my ear. "Mother
knows how true you are, Rhoda!"</p>

<p>After all there was really something
for which to thank Lily-Ann.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE OLD MAJOR</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/trim.png" width="500" height="20" alt="Decoration" />
</div>


<div class="unindent1"><span class="smcap">About</span> our house there was a garden,
with round beds of blooming plants,
and a shady apple-tree or two to break
the glare of the summer sun. In one
corner the hollyhocks grew, and along
the path to the gate purple flags appeared
each spring in uneven rows, like
isolated bands of soldiers marching on
a common enemy. There were dandelions
in the grass, and a lilac bush near
the front door. Here I used to play,
in a bright pink sun-bonnet, and little
black slippers which buttoned with a
band about my ankle. Secretly I considered
myself rather beautiful, and as
for my conquests, they stretched down
the street and around the block. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
was the grocer's boy, and the elderly
lady from over the way, who wore one
kind of hair in the morning and another
kind in the afternoon, and ordinary
strangers passing through the town,
and, last of all, but first in my estimation,
the old major.</div>

<p>Every day at the same hour he passed
the house, leaning on a cane. When
the sun was bright he stepped along
quickly, with an alert carriage of the
head; but there were cloudy days when
his step was slow and feeble, and even
his smile lost some of its usual charm.</p>

<p>"Hello, little girl," he said, in a ponderous
fashion, the first time that he
saw me perched on the gate. "Hello!
Hello! Hello!"</p>

<p>The hellos reached a long distance,
and grew very gruff at the end, but
there was a twinkle in his eye, and he
had a beautiful bright star on his watch-chain,
with which I longed to play.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>I gravely put out a small hand to
him.</p>

<p>"My name is Rhoda," I said, in a
burst of confidence. "I live here in this
house. I was six years old yesterday."</p>

<p>"Were you!" he replied, evidently
much impressed. "That's very old,
very old."</p>

<p>He went on slowly down the block,
but when he turned on his way back,
he stopped again at the gate to discuss
my age.</p>

<p>"Six, was it?" he questioned. "Well!
Well! Perhaps you can tell me what
time it is."</p>

<p>I shook my head, with a fascinated
look at the gleaming star.</p>

<p>"I haven't a watch."</p>

<p>"But you don't need a watch," he
answered. "See here."</p>

<p>He stooped down, painfully, grasping
the fence for support, and picked the
snowy seed-ball of a dandelion plant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Then he straightened up, slowly, and
blew at the feathery toy.</p>

<p>"One, two, three, four, five! Five
o'clock. Time for the old major to go
in out of the damp."</p>

<p>Then he turned away from me, and
went on up the street, his cane digging
little holes in the path, and he himself
forgetting all about the child whom he
had left still perched on her gate. I
had not entirely passed from his memory,
however, for when he came to his
own gate far in the distance, he took
off his hat, and gallantly waved it to
me before he went in out of the damp.</p>

<p>"Mother, I love the old major!" I
said one day.</p>

<p>"What major?" my mother asked,
looking up from her work with a smile.</p>

<p>She was making small ruffled skirts
and aprons with pockets. She could
make the most beautiful things, all out
of her own head.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"What major? Why, my major.
Mother, has the old major any little
girls or boys that I could play with?
Oh, I should so like to play with his
little girls and boys!"</p>

<p>"Major Daniel Clark hasn't any
little girls or boys. He lost them all,
dear. He is a very lonely man."</p>

<p>"Didn't he ever find them again,
mother?"</p>

<p>"No, dear. Never again."</p>

<p>Now, I was very good at finding
things. I found grandmother's spectacles
ten times a day, even when they
were only lost in her soft, white hair.
And once I found mother's thimble when
little brother Dick had it in his mouth,
and it was just going down red lane.
Norah said that I had a pair of bright
eyes, and my very father, when he
wanted his slippers, could think of no
one so trustworthy to send as I. To
find little girls and boys would be quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
easy, for they were much larger things.
I had only to ask all the girls and boys
who came past my gate if they belonged
to the major, and, when the right ones
came, we would run hand-in-hand up
to that distant door and go in. He
would be so pleased, and never lonely
again. And, perhaps&mdash;Just suppose
that he would be my friend forever and
ever!</p>

<p>I was waiting on my gate the next
day when he came by.</p>

<p>"Oh, Major!" I cried, excitedly,
nodding my head at him, "I'm going
to find your little girls and boys for
you!"</p>

<p>"My little girls and boys?" he asked,
perplexed.</p>

<p>"Yes. The ones that you lost so long
ago."</p>

<p>He turned quite suddenly on his way,
so quickly that I thought that he was
angry, but when he came back he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
stopped at the gate again. He took
my face softly between his hands,
and looked down deep into my eyes,
into the little circles where there were
pictures.</p>

<p>"When you grow up, always remember
that the old major loved you," he
said, hurriedly, and then went back
toward the house from which he had
come out so shortly before.</p>

<p>We were great friends after that.
We held long conversations over the
gate, about my dolls, and the hobby-horse
which had lately come to live in
the hall. We discussed the best way to
raise children, and how convenient it
would be if aprons could only be made
to button in front. We both had original
ideas on things, and often differed,
but none of my new clothes ever seemed
quite real to me until the major had
admired them, and pinched my cheeks
with that air of gallantry which showed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
that I was a woman. He brought me
presents, very wonderful things; bright
pebbles which he picked up on the street,
willow whistles, and a tiny basket carved
from a peach-stone, which I hung on a
ribbon about my neck. I gave him
flowers, and once, when no one was looking,
I let him kiss me in the shadow of
the pink sunbonnet.</p>

<p>If the major and I met thus on the
sunny days, when it rained there came
a blank in my life. Then he could not
go out at all, but must stay shut up in
his house until the weather cleared again.
There was something the matter with
the major which made this necessary.
In some unaccountable way he was different
from other people, and to be
different from other people was sad,
and was, moreover, a thing which never
happened in our family.</p>

<p>Now, grandmother had a little red
brick house that stood on her mantel-piece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
which aided me a great deal in
the stormy times. A little man and
woman lived in this house who were
never of the same mind, and carried
their lack of sympathy to such an
alarming extent that they used separate
doors, and, as far as I could see, had
never met in the course of their lives.
For as sure as the man with the umbrella
came out of one door, the little
lady with the roses in her bonnet gathered
up her skirts, and scurried in as
if she were afraid to meet him. With
her went the sunshine and the blue look
to the sky, and the rain came down
heavy and fast. But if the old man went
into his house, the old lady sprang out,
with a smile on her face, the rain
stopped falling, and the sun came out.
Then, by and by, the major would
walk down the street, and stop to chat
awhile.</p>

<p>I used to run into grandmother's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
room every morning to look at that
house.</p>

<p>"Grandma," I cried, eagerly, "has
the little lady come out to-day?"</p>

<p>Then I took my stand soberly in
front of the mantelpiece and regarded
the two figures with much attention.</p>

<p>"Grandma," I said once, "do you
think that they can be relations?"</p>

<p>Grandmother took up a stitch in her
knitting without replying.</p>

<p>"Because, if they are," I went on,
indignantly, "I think that they ought
to be ashamed!"</p>

<p>"Ashamed of what, Rhoda?"</p>

<p>"Why, of the way that they act.
They don't even look at each other!
And, grandma, I think that he's the
worst. He goes in with such a click
when she comes out. He's so afraid
that she'll say something to him."</p>

<p>Grandmother looked up over her
spectacles.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now that I come to think of it,"
she said, "they've acted that way for
forty years."</p>

<p>"I wonder why he don't like her?"
I went on, musingly. "Is it because
she's got flowers in her bonnet, and he
hasn't? Look, grandma, she's coming
out very quietly. She's going to catch
him this time. Oh, he's gone in with
a click! And he never said a word!"</p>

<p>"We'll have fair weather now, Rhoda."</p>

<p>"And my major will come out,
grandma."</p>

<p>"He's my major!" little Dick cried.</p>

<p>"He's my major!" Beatrice asserted.</p>

<p>"No such thing!" I said, turning on
them angrily. "He belongs all to me.
Don't he, grandma?"</p>

<p>Grandmother did not answer, but I
knew that he did. When the twins
came, hand-in-hand, down the path to
see him, he would pat their fat arms
through the spokes of the gate, but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
was always I to whom he wished to
talk, for I was more of his own age
and not a baby like them.</p>

<p>"Baby yourself!" Dick said, when I
mentioned this, and slapped me, but it
made no difference.</p>

<p>Sometimes the lady from across the
way would come over to walk with the
major. They were old friends, and had
a great deal to talk about. I remember
seeing her shake her finger at him when
she found him leaning on my gate.</p>

<p>"So you're trying to turn another
woman's head!" she cried, gayly.</p>

<p>He wheeled upon her with that sudden
straightening of his shoulders that
would come so unexpectedly.</p>

<p>"Did I ever turn yours, Kitty?" he
asked, with a mischievous smile.</p>

<p>"Dozens of times," she cried. "Dozens
of times!"</p>

<p>Then she took his arm, and they went
up and down in the bright sunshine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
up and down, while the major would
thump his cane upon the ground with
that gruff laugh that always seemed
merrier than other people's. His white
hair was smoothly brushed, and his black
hat was set on jauntily, and his kind
eyes shone as if he were young again.
I noticed that the lady from over the
way always wore a black silk dress and
her best, curly, brown hair whenever she
came to walk with the major, and, also,
a battered silver bracelet which looked
as if it had been chewed. The major
would glance at it and laugh.</p>

<p>"I took castor-oil to buy that bracelet,"
he said once, with his twinkle.</p>

<p>It sounded funny, but I knew just
what he meant. I had made dollars
and dollars myself taking castor-oil,
except that time when Auntie May
mixed it so cunningly with lemonade
that it went down and down to the
very dregs, and I never discovered until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
then how I had been cheated out of my
just dues.</p>

<p>"So that was it!" the lady from over
the way exclaimed, patting the bracelet.
"I always knew that there was something
curious about it."</p>

<p>"It was harder than leading a regiment
into action," the major answered,
soberly, and then broke into a gleeful
laugh. "I wouldn't do it for you
now!" he cried.</p>

<p>First she threatened him with the
bracelet. Then she took his arm again,
and they went on in the sunshine, talking
of all the many people whom they
had known in their lives. Her touch on
his arm was very light, guiding, and
sustaining, rather than dependent, but
the old major thought that she leant
upon him.</p>

<p>I was not jealous of the lady from
over the way. I felt that we shared
the major between us, and then it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
always at my gate that he stopped
first. It was here that he told me
about a trip that he was intending to
make.</p>

<p>"I'm going off to the city for a
week," he said.</p>

<p>"Are you, Major?" I questioned,
sorrowfully, for a week had seven days
in it, and even a day was a long, long
time. No wonder that my eyes were
full of tears.</p>

<p>"There, there," he said. "Bear it
like a woman."</p>

<p>I was not a woman, but sometimes
the major used to forget. I thought
that it was because I looked so tall
when I stood on my gate.</p>

<p>He put out his kind old hand and
smoothed my hair.</p>

<p>"What shall I bring you from the
city?" he asked. "A new doll? What
would you like best of all, Rhoda?"</p>

<p>I considered the question. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
were so many things that the major
might bring from the city. There were
little doll-babies, or picture-books, or
cups and saucers, or hooples with bells.
Then I had an inspiration. I leaned
forward in a glow of excitement.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 418px;">
<img src="images/i-002.jpg" width="418" height="600" alt="Girl sitting on gatepost" />
</div>

<p>"I should like&mdash;Oh, Major! Will
you really give it to me? I should like
the littlest watch in the world. With
a star! With a star, just like yours!"</p>

<p>"You shall have it," he answered,
promptly, as if there was nothing unusual
in such a grand request. "Now,
remember, if all goes well, I'll be at
the gate a week from to-day. And
I'll have that watch right here in my
pocket."</p>

<p>"And I'll bring flowers!" I cried,
joyfully. "All the flowers that you
love best, Major."</p>

<p>"Good-by," he said, with a sudden
touch of emotion.</p>

<p>"Good-by," I answered, rather tearfully,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>for even the watch could not reconcile
me to his absence.</p>

<p>He turned to go, and came back
again.</p>

<p>"Pray for the old major," he said,
in a husky whisper.</p>

<p>Through my tears I saw him go up
the block, a little slower than usual, as
if he did not want to go. At the gate
he stopped and waved his hat to me, as
he had done on that first day, and
squared his gallant old shoulders before
he passed into the house. I always
wished that I had kissed him before he
went.</p>

<p>It was not hard to pray for the major,
for I believed in the efficacy of prayer.
When the elastic bands became loosened
in the black doll, Topsy, and she lost
her wool and her legs at the same time,
I went down, solemnly, on my knees on
the floor, and prayed for them to grow
together again. And they did, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
night. And when I lost my little front
tooth, I prayed to God and He sent me
a new one! So it was not hard to pray
for the major. But somehow or other
I did not like to do it before my
mother. It seemed such a secret sort
of a prayer. I waited until I was safe
under the covers, and she had taken
away the light. Then I climbed out
of the bed, in the big darkness, and
went down on the floor. I prayed to
God to bless the old major, and bring
him back safely to me. I said it over
twice, so that God would not forget.</p>

<p>"So the old major has gone to the
city," my father said, at the breakfast
table. "I can remember him when he
was in the pride of his strength, a magnificent
figure on horseback. He never
rose as high in the service as he should.
He made powerful enemies and slipped
into the background."</p>

<p>"It's twenty years since his wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
died," my mother's soft voice added.
"He has lived alone in that big house
ever since. Think of it, Robert!"</p>

<p>"Such is the heart's fidelity," father
answered, with his face turned toward
hers.</p>

<p>"When he comes back we must make
more of him," mother said.</p>

<p>It was a very long week, but even
long weeks have a way of slipping by
at last. I played about the house and
the garden with the twins, but I never
went near the gate, not until the day
dawned which was seven times from last
Friday, and was Friday again, bright
and clear, the very day for the major's
home-coming. There were so many
flowers in the garden that morning,
such especially large ones. They knew,
too, that the major was coming home,
and had put on their prettiest dresses
in his honor.</p>

<p>It was quite a puzzle to me what I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
should put on. I had a closet full of
dresses. There was a beautiful blue
silk one, too good for anything but
church, which matched a little blue parasol.
And there was a lovely white one
with a lace flounce, which went with my
scolloped petticoat. My third best dress
had roses and buttons on it, and the
fourth best was covered with brown
spots, like cough drops. I loved my
little dresses, and it was so hard to tell
which dress should come out, and
which must stay shut up in the closet,
with nobody to admire them.</p>

<p>"Shall it be the cough drop dress,
mother?" I asked, uncertainly.</p>

<p>"It's such a wonderful day, and
the sun shines so bright, that I think
you might put on the white dress
with the lace flounce," my mother
said, with that smile which meant that
she was laughing with me, and not
at me.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>"And my little black slippers?"</p>

<p>"And your little black slippers."</p>

<p>"And, mother, you remember the
time that I was your little flower
girl? And you put roses in my hair
so it looked like a crown? I'd like
to be the major's little flower girl."</p>

<p>My mother lent herself to the
pretty idea. She crowned my head
with roses. There were roses at my
throat, and a big, floating, pink sash
swept down my back, and there were
roses in my hand for the major, one
bunch to give him with a kiss when he
came, and another to give him with my
love when he went.</p>

<p>Grandmother shook her wise head
when she saw that toilet.</p>

<p>"If she were my child," she said,
"I should dress her in brown gingham
down to her heels, and tie her
hair with shoe-laces."</p>

<p>I gasped, and mother laughed.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"She's vain," grandmother went
on, severely. "Suppose she should
grow up a poppet!"</p>

<p>I carried that awful name out with
me as I climbed upon the gate, and
stared out, bashfully, at the street. I
was afraid to think how beautiful I
might be.</p>

<p>The grocer's boy came by, my own
particular grocer's boy. Stricken
with sudden admiration for my
charms he put down his basket, and
expressed his sentiments.</p>

<p>"Say, you are a daisy!" he said.</p>

<p>"Go away, Jakie," I answered,
with embarrassment. "I haven't
time to play with you now. Go
away! I'm busy."</p>

<p>He was quite crushed by my new
haughtiness, and lingered about,
thinking that I would relent, but all
my smiles and flowers were waiting for
that bent figure which I loved so well.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>An hour slipped by, but still the
major did not come. My crown
grew heavy on my head, and the
flowers wilted in my hot hands. The
lady from over the way came to ask
me questions. She had on her ugliest
hair, and there were tears in her
eyes.</p>

<p>"What are you doing, Rhoda?"
she asked, with an anxious look.</p>

<p>Then she seemed to divine.</p>

<p>"You are not watching for the
major!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered, wearily.</p>

<p>"Doesn't your mother know,
child?" she cried. "But, then, he
never told any one. They found
that there must be an operation, and
he was not strong. There was no one
whom he loved there at the end. He
died, as he lived, all alone. Oh, poor
old man! Poor old man! Let me go
by, child! Let me go by!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>She thrust herself in the little gate,
wheeling me back against the fence,
and went up the path to our house.</p>

<p>Then, in hardly a moment, Norah
came out and led me in, and proceeded
to take off all my pretty things and
put on a common dress, quite an old
one, with a darn on the sleeve.</p>

<p>"I don't want that dress, Norah," I
protested. "I want my white dress. I
want to see my major. I want to be
his little flower girl."</p>

<p>I went in where my mother sat with
the lady from over the way, and explained
the situation through my tears.
Mother was very tender with me.
Somehow I felt that she herself was
sorry about something, for she dropped
a tear on the wilted roses which I still
held in my hand. Together we went
out into the garden. Together we
gathered all the flowers that there were&mdash;the
big ones and the little ones&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
formed them into a great bunch.
It was for the major. I danced with
sheer delight, knowing only too well
how the kind face would light up when
he saw all the flowers which he had
admired so often made a present to
him. I added buttercups, and dandelions,
and bits of feathery grass, while
mother watched me, with a sad smile,
and said never a word.</p>

<p>The lady from over the way cried
very hard on our front steps, but afterwards
she dried her eyes and took my
flowers to the major.</p>

<p>He did not come the next day or
the next, though I watched at the gate,
and then something strange happened.
I was told not to go into the garden.</p>

<p>"Not this morning, Rhoda," my
mother said. "Grandma and I are
going out, and you must stay in the
house. When we come back you may
go out."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>She dressed herself very quietly that
day, all in dark things, and she and
grandmother did not look joyful, as
they always did when they went out
together.</p>

<p>"I'd like to go, too," I said, wistfully.</p>

<p>Then Norah coaxed me.</p>

<p>"Ah, stay and play with your Norah,"
she cried. "Sure you'll not be after
leaving your Norah alone in this big
house!"</p>

<p>I always liked to play with Norah,
when her work was done and she had
time to be sociable. That day we
played blindman's buff together&mdash;she,
and I and the twins. Norah was always
the blind man, and she was the longest
time catching us, and when she did she
could never tell who it might be. She
would guess quite impossible people,&mdash;the
grocer's boy, and the lady from over
the way, and her own very mother in
Ireland,&mdash;and she never once, by any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
chance, thought that it was Rhoda or
little Dick or Trixie.</p>

<p>"Sure, you're too big to be Trixie!"
she cried, when we told her who it
was.</p>

<p>That day, when the blind man was
out of breath, and his feet were sore
from walking hundreds of miles, I
climbed up on the window-sill and
watched the people going along the
street. There were a great many of
them, much more than usual. Suddenly
there was the sound of a fife
and drum in the distance, and a long
line of carriages came into sight, and
one was filled with beautiful flowers,
and one was draped with a torn old
flag.</p>

<p>"Come quick, Norah!" I cried,
eagerly. "It's a procession!"</p>

<p>"It's the old major's funeral," Norah
said, coming with the twins in her arms
to look over my shoulder.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>I had known, somehow, that it was
the major's, for everything nice belonged
to him. I was so proud to think
that my major should have all that big
procession, with the lovely flowers and
the music in front. I looked for him
in every carriage, that I might wave
as he went by. He was not there, but
other people were,&mdash;my mother and
my grandmother, and the lady from
over the way, and men with gold braid
on their coats come to grace the major's
procession.</p>

<p>"Is it all his, Norah?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Sure, dear."</p>

<p>"I am so glad," I cried. "Oh, I'm
so glad!"</p>

<p>I clapped my hands in my delight,
and was quite angry with Norah when
she dragged me, hurriedly, away from
the window.</p>

<p>That night my mother took me in
her lap, and told me that the old major<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
had gone to heaven. I had heard of
heaven before. It was where I came
from, and the twins, away back in the
early days. Heaven was a nice place,
and now, as the major's home, it acquired
a new charm. But there was
one drawback.</p>

<p>"Shan't I ever see him again,
mother?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Never again, Rhoda."</p>

<p>"But, mother, it's a children's place," I
urged, anxiously. "And the major is old,
quite old. He won't like it there, mother."</p>

<p>"The major has gone to heaven to
be a little child again," my mother said,
with a sob.</p>

<p>Then she put a blue velvet box in my
hand. Inside there was the littlest watch
in the world, and on the back of the
watch there was a star in blue stones.
It was the last thing which the old major
bought before he went to heaven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<div class="unindent1">"<span class="smcap">England</span> is a long way off," grandmother
said, softly. "Especially at
Christmas time."</div>

<p>She was not talking to any one in
particular, but just to herself. She
had been sitting for quite awhile by
the parlor window reading her Bible.
Sometimes her eyes were fastened on
the page, and sometimes when a strange
step came down the street, she would
glance up hurriedly, almost in an eager
way, as if she were watching for some
one. Then, when she saw who it was,
her eyes would drop again on the book
in a disappointed fashion. I knew what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
she would do next. Very slowly she
would turn the pages right to the middle
of the Bible, where a picture lay between
the leaves.</p>

<p>"Isn't that father, grandma?" I
asked, anxiously, leaning against her
knee.</p>

<p>"No, Rhoda," she said, in that decisive
way of hers.</p>

<p>I hung closer over the picture to
make real sure.</p>

<p>It looked so like father when he was
a little boy that I thought she must be
mistaken. Yet somehow it was different.
This little boy was fairer. There
was a curl of hair on the page, a light-brown
curl with red glints in it, and a
tiny wreath made of pressed lilacs which
once upon a time he had joined together,
flower by flower, out in our
front garden. I could almost see him
doing it, while the wind blew through
those brown curls.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I do hope that he isn't grown
up!" I cried, quickly.</p>

<p>People had such an astonishing way
of growing up fast. Why, even Joseph
in his pretty new coat in the Bible was
not a little boy any longer! And I had
always so longed to play with Joseph.</p>

<p>Grandmother did not tell me anything
more about the picture. She took
it out of my hand, and put it back on
the page beside the curl and the faded
lilac ring. Then she closed the book
tightly; but when I ran into the parlor
five minutes later to announce a visitor
the picture was out again on her lap.</p>

<p>"Evelyn is coming, grandma!" I
cried.</p>

<p>The tall young lady who followed me
into the room was grandmother's great
friend, and, also, in a way she was mine.
I loved her because she was so beautiful;
but grandmother loved her because
they both liked a man named Frank.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
He was engaged to Evelyn. I had
heard my mother say so.</p>

<p>"Is there any news?" grandmother
asked, eagerly.</p>

<p>She had risen out of her chair and
looked startled.</p>

<p>Evelyn went up to her with a letter
in her hand.</p>

<p>"Frank is quite well," she said, "and
very busy. Would you like to see his
letter?"</p>

<p>Grandmother hesitated. She almost
turned her back upon Evelyn.</p>

<p>"No," she answered, slowly. "No.
When he writes a letter to <i>me</i>, I will
read it. Not before."</p>

<p>"Oh, you are hard on Frank," Evelyn
protested. "How can he write to you?
Didn't you say you would have nothing
more to do with him, unless he gave up
his profession?"</p>

<p>"Profession! Has an actor a profession?"
grandmother cried. "This is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
first time I ever heard it called by that
name. I said he was to choose between
his mother and a child's mad whim, and
he made his choice."</p>

<p>She picked up the picture and looked
at it with tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>"I could forgive him anything but
acting," she said. "Sometimes I think
I could even forgive him that. I do so
long to see him again."</p>

<p>Evelyn slipped her arm about grandmother.</p>

<p>"He will come back," she cried, consolingly.</p>

<p>"Never," grandmother replied, with a
despairing glance at the empty street.
"Don't I know him, Evelyn? Man and
boy? He is as stubborn as I am."</p>

<p>"Would the little boy play with me,
grandma, if he came back?" I asked,
excitedly.</p>

<p>They both looked at me, but Evelyn
was the only one who smiled.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps," she said. "He used to
be very fond of you."</p>

<p>After that I was always watching for
the little boy. Every morning when I
got up I looked out of the window to see
if he were not coming in our gate. And
the last thing before I went to bed, I
looked out carefully again. I thought
that I should know him by his hair, and
I felt how lovely it would be if he would
only come at Christmas time. Christmas
was not going to be so nice that year as
usual. I did not think that I should get
anything. There were lots of presents
in the house for other children, even my
little brother and sister, but somehow
there did not seem to be any for Rhoda!</p>

<p>"Father," I said, one morning,
"there's a very pretty book in your
top drawer. A child's book. I wonder
whose it is?"</p>

<p>He was quite busy reading his paper,
but he answered me at once.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's for a little friend of mine,"
he declared. "It's a secret."</p>

<p>"Oh! Is she a good girl, father?"</p>

<p>He glanced at me and laughed.</p>

<p>"Sometimes she's awfully good," he
answered.</p>

<p>Then it was not for me. Nobody
ever seemed to think that I was good,
not even when I was trying my best.
It must be grand to be good! Just
think of being born that way, so that
you could not help it, but went on
growing better and better until you
died! There was a little girl down the
street like that. We played together
on sunny days. I found it very hard
to play with any one who was so
good.</p>

<p>"And sometimes," my father went on,
still with that smile in his eyes, "sometimes
she's so dreadfully bad that I'm
really shocked!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" I said again.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>I had seen my father shocked. When
he was shocked, he always laughed very
hard.</p>

<p>"Has it pictures, father?" I asked,
meekly, trying to turn the subject.</p>

<p>"No. My little friend doesn't care
about pictures," he answered, indifferently.</p>

<p>Then it was not for me. I was very
fond of pictures. Everybody knew that.
It did seem queer that in all the many
packages which he brought home, night
after night,&mdash;round ones, and square
ones, and even some with mysterious
humpy corners,&mdash;there should not be
a single thing for Rhoda! And Christmas
was coming faster and faster.</p>

<p>Evelyn, too, had all manner of pretty
presents laid by for other little girls,
quite strange little girls, who did not
love her at all so far as I could see,
but she never said a word about my
present; not even one day when she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
called me into her house and opened her
parlor door. She opened it very softly,
as if there were company, and she put
her finger on her lip that I should not
speak.</p>

<p>There was company. Inside the room
was filled with dolls! They sat in rows
on the sofa and on the piano, they lay
in careless heaps on the chairs and
tables; blue-eyed dolls and black-eyed
dolls, some that went promptly to sleep
when you laid them down, some in
Japanese dresses, and some that wore
long clothes and caps like sure enough
babies. We went about solemnly, hand
in hand, and looked at them all. They
stared back as if they wanted a mother,
and one on the center-table, a queen of
a doll with earrings in her ears, held out
her arms to come to me!</p>

<p>"Whom do you think they're all
for?" Evelyn asked, gayly. "Guess."</p>

<p>I held her closer by the hand and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
gazed about me. <i>I</i> was very fond of
dolls. I had never had enough. I believed
that once or twice I had mentioned
the fact. I drew a long breath.
Just suppose&mdash;</p>

<p>"They're for orphans," Evelyn cried,
quickly. "You know what orphans are,
don't you, Rhoda? They are poor children
who haven't any mothers or fathers
to buy them dolls! It's a very sad thing
to be an orphan."</p>

<p>I glanced about me again. The queen
was very beautiful.</p>

<p>"Will they be good to them?" I questioned,
wistfully.</p>

<p>I had heard of people whipping dolls!
And once a little boy had drowned a
doll! His sister's! It was dreadful!</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sure this doll is going to
be spoiled," Evelyn answered, with her
hand on the queen.</p>

<p>I looked from her to the great doll
with shy admiration. They both had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the same fair hair, and the same pink
cheeks and the same gray eyes. Their
faces were just like flowers.</p>

<p>"I think her name is Evelyn, too,"
I said.</p>

<p>I had always thought that Evelyn
liked me, but that day I was sure of
it. We had a long talk in a big chair
about all the things which I wanted for
Christmas. She said that I was surely
to come Christmas morning and see the
orphans get their dolls. Somebody
named Santa Claus would be there. I
had heard of Santa Claus before, but
only in a general sort of a way. He
seemed to be a very kindly sort of person
who gave away dolls by the hundred,
sometimes to orphans, and sometimes
just to little girls who needed
them. It was a question how much you
had to need them.</p>

<p>At the very last Evelyn gave me a
message to deliver.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>"Rhoda," she said, earnestly, "tell
grandmother that there is good news.
What she was wishing for is really
going to happen!"</p>

<p>She hugged me up closer to her.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a Christmas this will
be!" she cried. "We are all going to
get what we want, all of us, even
Rhoda!"</p>

<p>Afterwards she changed. When I
went out of the door she drew me back
and looked at me anxiously, almost
coldly.</p>

<p>"Rhoda, don't tell grandmother anything,"
she said. "It might be a mistake.
I wouldn't have her disappointed
for the world!"</p>

<p>I did not want grandmother to be
disappointed, but still when I went back
into our house and saw her sitting by
the window, I felt that I should like
to tell her some good news. Just that
once. She looked so frail and old, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
I had never noticed before how white
her hair was.</p>

<p>My mother was very tender with
grandmother. Every morning she would
send her three children, the twins and
me, to kiss her, and when my father
came home at night she would send him
to lean on the back of the big chair,
and look down at the closed Bible.
Grandmother never took the picture
out when my father was there. She
never even listened to the people passing
by outside. She would talk to him
about other things in which neither of
them took much interest, until he would
go away, half sadly, half angrily.</p>

<p>"She is the most absurd woman who
ever lived," he told my mother. "Here
is Frank winning laurels by the dozen,
and, on account of her stupid prejudice,
she won't listen to his name. Does she
expect to keep this thing up forever?"</p>

<p>"She is thinking of him all the time,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
my mother said, quietly. "She loves
him."</p>

<p>"I know she loves him!" my father
cried. "She loves him better than she
does me. I was always the one who
didn't count! Always."</p>

<p>My mother laid her hand upon his
arm and stopped him.</p>

<p>"Hush, Robert," she said.</p>

<p>Her eyes wandered over me sitting
on my stool by the fireplace, and passed
to little brother Dick playing with his
blocks.</p>

<p>"Who can judge a mother's heart?"
she questioned, softly, and then turned
upon him with a demand that was almost
wrathful. "Have you nothing to
be thankful for," she cried, "that you
grudge him a thought at Christmas
time!"</p>

<p>My mother always took grandmother's
part. She seemed to understand grandmother
better than my father did. Once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
I heard her say that the curl in the Bible
was like one of little Dick's. She laid
it against his soft hair, and it matched,
color and curl, as if it had been cut
from his head. After that she was even
kinder to grandmother than before.</p>

<p>Norah out in the kitchen was the
happiest person in the house. Every
night she wrote home to Ireland, and
sometimes she laughed and sometimes
she cried. I liked to hear about Ireland.
I would climb upon the kitchen
table and watch her write, and listen
when she read bits of her letters to me.
I knew all about Norah's people, and
could call her brothers and sisters, and
even her cousins, by name. She was
sending money in her letter to buy her
mother a new green plaid shawl for
Christmas. She was, also, going to buy
the priest a pig. Norah was worried
about the priest. He gave away everything
that he had to the poor of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
parish, and went hungry all the time.
After much thought she had decided
on the present of a pig, as being a
thing which the priest might keep for
himself.</p>

<p>"Though they're that owdacious,
Rhoda," she cried, in high wrath, "that
I'm thinking they'll take the pig, too!"</p>

<p>"What would they do with the pig,
Norah?" I asked, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Sure, they might eat it!" she answered,
with a dark frown.</p>

<p>"Norah, what if you were to put a
blue ribbon about its neck?" I suggested.</p>

<p>She went into fits of laughter and
hugged me.</p>

<p>"To think that you've niver even
seen a pig!" she cried. "To think of
it dressed up! The innocent!"</p>

<p>It was on that same night that with
a great parade of secrecy she showed
me something hidden in the knife tray.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
It was a doll's hat made of blue velvet,
and trimmed with lovely white feathers,
such as came out of the pillows when
Norah thumped them in the morning.
Right in front there was a big brass pin
that shone like gold. Norah watched
me while I examined the hat, breathlessly.
She seemed much pleased with
my admiration, and turned it around
and around on one of her big fingers
that I might decide on the prettiest
side, which was, of course, the one with
the brass pin.</p>

<p>"But whom is it for, Norah?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"It's for a small frind of mine," she
explained, with an air of deep mystery.</p>

<p>It was very strange. The dolls and
the picture-book, even the hat, were all
for somebody's little friend, never for
me.</p>

<p>"I wonder what I'll get?" I said,
weakly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why don't you ask Santa Claus,
dear?" Norah inquired.</p>

<p>I looked at her quickly. That was
Evelyn's friend.</p>

<p>"Who is he, Norah?" I questioned.</p>

<p>She threw up her arms in the air.</p>

<p>"And have I niver told you about
him?" she cried. "The quare ould chap
that lives up in the chimney!"</p>

<p>"Up in the chimney, Norah! Isn't
he hot?" I demanded, in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Faith, there's no fire could warm
him," Norah answered, lowering her
voice mysteriously.</p>

<p>Then her finger went up in apparent
alarm.</p>

<p>"Hush! He's listening! He wants
to know which are the good byes and
gurrls. When Christmas morning comes
the good ones will get prisents. For
he owns all the prisents in the world!
And the bad ones will get nought, barring
switches!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>I crept a little closer to Norah, and
took a firm hold on her apron. It was
very sudden news. Had I always been
good?</p>

<p>"But the good childer," Norah went
on, with a reassuring smile, "and you
are good, Rhoda, have only to ask for
whativer they want at the parlor fireplace!"</p>

<p>I could not keep away from the fireplace
after that. Every time that I
went into the parlor I peeped up the
black bricks, and though I never saw
anything but the blue sky far, far above,
I felt quite sure that he was there. I
made little scenes in my mind of the
things which I should say to him, and
the things which he would say to me,
after he became convinced of my goodness.
In the meanwhile I was good,
oh, so good! and best of all in the
parlor. Later, I meant to ask for the
queen doll, and the pretty book, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the little hat trimmed with the white
feathers and the beautiful brass pin.
Even if he could not give me just those
ones, because they were promised, he
might give me others. I felt that he
could manage it in some way, if he were
pleased with me. It was nice to know
that he was partial to good girls.</p>

<p>Once I went so far as to speak his
name.</p>

<p>"Mr. Santa Claus!" I called, politely,
for it was best to be polite. "Oh,
please, Mr. Santa Claus!"</p>

<p>A big piece of soot dropped down
over the burning wood right at my
feet. That was his way of showing that
he heard! Then I was frightened, and
would have run away but for a sudden
sound. Somebody was crying! It was
grandmother up in the corner of the
sofa with the Bible on her knees. She
did not see me at all. She did not
know that I was there. I put my arms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
around her neck, and she looked up and
talked to me quite as if I were a grown
person.</p>

<p>"I want him so badly, Rhoda!" she
said.</p>

<p>"Who is it, grandma?" I whispered.</p>

<p>"My little boy, Rhoda. He went
away and he never came back again. I
was not patient enough with him. Always
be patient, my dear."</p>

<p>"Don't you cry, grandma," I said.
"I'll get him back, dear grandma, if
you won't cry."</p>

<p>She looked at me for a moment as
if she almost believed me. I nodded
confidently at her. I knew. There was
a way, but only little Rhoda had thought
of it as yet. If Norah had only told
me sooner about Santa Claus!</p>

<p>After she had dried her eyes, and
kissed me, and gone to her room, I put
my plan into execution. I told Santa
Claus all about it up the black bricks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
He did not answer, but the soot fell
softly, so I knew that he heard and
would remember. It was no longer a
question of dolls or books or even
hats. I felt that the one thing which
I wanted most in the world was just
for grandmother's little boy to come
home.</p>

<p>I did not hang up my stocking on
Christmas eve. The twins hung up
theirs,&mdash;two little podgy stockings side
by side at the mantel-piece. Even quite
a small stocking will hold candy, and I
have known times when the very nicest
present of all would be away down at
the toe. My little Susan Sunshine, my
littlest doll, came in the toe. I found
her after I thought everything was out.
I wondered whether Dick or Trixie
would find a little Susan Sunshine.</p>

<p>"Why don't sister hang up her stocking?"
Dick asked, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Is she bad?" Trixie inquired.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm not bad," I declared, hastily,
from my bed in the next room.</p>

<p>"Why don't you hang up your stocking,
dear?" mother questioned.</p>

<p>"I don't want anything," I answered,
miserably.</p>

<p>Afterwards I heard her talking to my
father.</p>

<p>"I don't know what to make of
Rhoda," I heard her say. "She won't
hang up her stocking. I hope that she
is not going to be sick. It would be
dreadful to have one of the children
sick at Christmas time. Her head is
quite hot."</p>

<p>I felt my head. It was hot.</p>

<p>I lay awake for a long time thinking
of things. I considered the twins and
their stockings, and grandmother's delight
in the morning. Somehow I had
to think a great deal about grandmother
in order to keep myself from
crying. Grandmother did not know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
what I was doing for her. The little
boy must be getting ready to come
right now. Off in the distance I could
hear sleigh-bells, perhaps his sleigh-bells,
now near, now far away, and in the
pauses between the soft throb of the
organ over in the church, and a voice
singing a hymn, the one that I knew
about angels and the manger with the
Child. It was very beautiful. I sighed
a little, sleepily. After all I was
happy.</p>

<p>Then in a moment it was day, bright
day, and in the next room there was a
confused murmur of voices and a hurried
scamper of feet. Dick shouted excitedly.
Somebody beat a drum with a
low rumble like soldiers, not as a little
boy would beat a drum, but as my father
might if he were teaching a little boy.
Somebody marched pitapat about the
room, and somebody danced by the fireplace.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go back to your cribs," my mother
cried, uneasily. "You'll get your death
of cold!"</p>

<p>On the chair by the side of my bed
there was a stocking, with queer knobby
places, which meant oranges, and square
places, which meant candy. Right on
top there was a blue velvet hat trimmed
with white feathers, and against the
stocking there leant a picture-book. I
looked at them incredulously. Santa
Claus had not understood! Or else he
had thought that I loved my presents
better than I did my grandmother! I
kissed the hat and the picture-book
twice, and then I put them sternly back
on the chair. I knew what I should
do. Santa Claus would find that I
meant what I said.</p>

<p>"Did you like the picture-book,
Rhoda?" my father inquired at the
breakfast table.</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered, hurriedly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Norah smiled at me from the shelter
of the kitchen door.</p>

<p>"How did my little frind like the
hat?" she asked, in a stage whisper.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that there were some
subjects which would not bear talking
about.</p>

<p>They felt my head a great many
times that morning, and even looked at
my tongue.</p>

<p>"She acts so unlike herself," my
mother said, anxiously. "You don't
feel sick anywhere, do you, Rhoda?"</p>

<p>"No," I replied, huskily.</p>

<p>Grandmother evinced a sudden interest.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't let her go to Evelyn's,"
she said.</p>

<p>"But I want to go!" I cried, piteously.</p>

<p>"There, there," my father said, in a
soothing way. "Of course you may
go."</p>

<p>"Only you must take an iron pill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
first," my mother pleaded. "Just to
please mother."</p>

<p>She did the pill up very neatly in a
raisin, so that it did not look at all like
a pill. My mother could make the most
horrible things look nice,&mdash;such as cough
syrup, with little specks of jelly floating
on it like a pudding. Afterwards
you might know by the taste that there
had been something wrong, but you could
never tell beforehand; not even though
you might wonder at dessert being kindly
offered for breakfast.</p>

<p>I took my pill meekly, and drank a
glass of milk to please my father. Then
after much consultation they put on my
cloak, and let me go. I had the picture-book
and the hat hidden under my arm
as I went out the door, but nobody
noticed.</p>

<p>Evelyn's house was farther down the
street, not quite out of sight from our
front gate, but still at a little distance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
There were orphans going in when I
came up,&mdash;orphans in decorous rows
of twos; each little girl with a white
apron hanging down under her cloak.
They went in very quietly, not at all
as if they were excited at the prospect.
I felt that they could not
know what was inside. I watched
to see them dance when they passed
the parlor door, but they only stared
stolidly.</p>

<p>"A merry Christmas to all of you,"
a sonorous voice cried within.</p>

<p>I peeped in cautiously. There he was!
That was Santa Claus. He stood by
a beautiful tree at the top of the room.
He had on a white fur coat, and there
was a shaggy cap on his head. He
smiled at us. It almost seemed that he
smiled at me, little Rhoda Harcourt, as
if he remembered the chimney! His
arms were full of dolls, but I knew at
first glance that I could never really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
like him. There was something about
his face that made it impossible.</p>

<p>"These dolls are only for good girls,"
he said again, in a loud voice that had
a muffled sound.</p>

<p>I slipped in closer. The orphans
stared back at him unconcernedly. They
were sure that they were good. One,
a very sleepy orphan, put her head on
her chair, and went fast to sleep in the
most impolite way.</p>

<p>"Here, wake up!" the next orphan
said, and slapped her.</p>

<p>She woke up and slapped her neighbor
back, and was going to sleep again
when Santa Claus called her name. It
was Betsy. He gave Betsy the first doll.
He was evidently quite satisfied with her
behavior. I was much surprised.</p>

<p>The dolls went quickly after that, all
except the queen. She sat up high on
the tree, and her eyes had a frightened
look, as though she did not like orphans.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Once Santa Claus took her down, but
Evelyn put her back again.</p>

<p>"Not that one, Frank," I heard her
cry.</p>

<p>He turned and whispered something
to her behind the tree. The branches
were very thick, but for a moment I
almost thought that his face grew different,
younger and fairer, and with a
gleam of triumphant laughter about it
quite unlike the Santa Claus that he had
been before. Then he changed again,
and came out, with his long beard flowing
and his fierce white eyebrows frowning,
to give away more dolls.</p>

<p>At the very end of all he picked up
the queen, and called gruffly, "Rhoda!"</p>

<p>I peered out of my corner at the
orphans. I could not see any orphan
Rhoda among them. Just suppose that
Santa Claus should mean me! He did
mean me! He beckoned with what he
thought was a friendly look.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>"Rhoda," Evelyn cried. "Why,
you're not afraid, are you, dear?"</p>

<p>"No," I answered, hastily.</p>

<p>I do not think that she quite believed
me, for she took me by the hand and
led me up to where Santa Claus stood
waiting with the queen in his arms. It
was evident that he had forgotten everything,
everything that I had ever told
him.</p>

<p>"This is for you," he said in a genial
way, holding out the doll.</p>

<p>The queen looked at me with delighted
eyes, the dear queen! but I
could not take her. I gave him the hat
and the picture-book in a hurry.</p>

<p>"I don't want these," I said. "You
know what I want. I told you up the
chimney. And you promised to bring
him to me. You know that you did!"</p>

<p>He seemed a little astonished for a
moment, and then he laughed.</p>

<p>"Did I?" he questioned. "What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
chimney was that? You see I go up
so many that sometimes I forget."</p>

<p>"What did you want, Rhoda?" Evelyn
asked in surprise, putting her arms
around me. "Tell Evelyn."</p>

<p>"I want grandmother's little boy to
come home," I answered, almost crying.
"The little boy who made the
lilac ring. All day long she watches
for him. I don't like to see poor grandmother
cry!"</p>

<p>There were other things which I might
have said, but Evelyn stopped me with
a backward glance at the rows of orphans
agog on their chairs, and a lady
or two who had come with them watching
in the background. Even Santa
Claus was startled.</p>

<p>"A touch of tragedy," he said. "Who
is this child?"</p>

<p>"Can't you guess?" Evelyn whispered.
"What was I telling you just
now!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>He looked down at me with sudden
enlightenment.</p>

<p>"Rhoda!" he cried, uncertainly. "It's
not our Rhoda? She was a baby."</p>

<p>"But babies grow in five years,"
Evelyn replied, in a laughing tone.</p>

<p>He stooped lower and drew me to
him.</p>

<p>"Whatever I promised I will do," he
said, emphatically. "If you wanted the
whole world I would give it to you
to-day!"</p>

<p>He threw off the long yellow cloak
that was wrapped about him and did
something to his face. In a moment he
was just a man like other men, and
had me upon his shoulder. Somehow it
seemed to me that I had been on his
shoulder before when the floor was farther
away.</p>

<p>"Almost too big for the old perch,"
he said, with a laugh that was half
merry and half tremulous.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, don't forget her doll!" Evelyn
cried.</p>

<p>She came a little closer to him so that
she could whisper.</p>

<p>"I honor you for this," she said,
ardently.</p>

<p>Then she put the queen on his other
arm, and gave me the hat and picture-book
to carry. The orphans laughed a
little, but Santa Claus did not mind.
He strode out into the sunshine with
his heavy load, and started up the block.
The bells were ringing for service as we
went along, and the street was filled
with people, but I was the only little
girl in the whole town whom Santa
Claus took home. And at our parlor
window grandmother was looking out.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

</div>


<div class="unindent1"><span class="smcap">There</span> had been a family council in
which my relatives had all sat around,
gravely, and talked about me and my
conduct. It was a painful affair. They
had mentioned every bad thing which I
had done in the course of a whole week,
some of which I had not thought they
knew about, and then in the middle of
it all grandmother Harcourt had made
an announcement.</div>

<p>"Rhoda's behavior grows worse and
worse," she had advanced, severely.
"And as for her manners, she's a regular
Hottentot!"</p>

<p>"Hottentot, eh?" granddad Lawrence
repeated, whimsically.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>He had me upon his knee, and as he
spoke he turned my face toward his,
and regarded it with much apparent interest.
I gazed back at him wistfully.
He was company, and it was very hard
that company should hear me called a
Hottentot. I was sure that I did not
look like that dreadful name which had
suddenly sprung upon grandmother's
lips. It had such an awful sound!</p>

<p>"She's no worse than other children,"
my mother urged, in defence.</p>

<p>She might blame me herself, but when
grandmother Harcourt looked over her
spectacles and invented names my mother
was sure to grow angry.</p>

<p>"It seems to me that I've heard about
Hottentots before," granddad Lawrence
went on, nodding his head. "They're
very fond of candy, Hottentots are, and
they like their own way. Yes, they like
their own way."</p>

<p>"Not any more than other children,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
my mother said again. "Rhoda gets
into mischief solely because she has
nothing to do."</p>

<p>"Why don't you send her to school?"
granddad Lawrence asked. "She is
seven years old."</p>

<p>"Oh, I couldn't send her to school!"
my mother cried, anxiously.</p>

<p>"No, not yet," grandmother protested,
in her turn.</p>

<p>It was the one subject upon which
they agreed.</p>

<p>"Well, let her take lessons in something,
then. There's the piano standing
untouched. I've heard of Hottentots
who had a very good ear for music."</p>

<p>He pinched my ear as he spoke, and
puffed out his cheeks in a funny way,
as he always did when he wanted to
laugh. He had very little hair on his
head, and a round, pink face like a
baby's, and a pair of wicked blue eyes
that saw everything, both before and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
behind him. I had never heard of
granddad Lawrence being cross. He
was good to everybody, from the little
newsboy who ran after him every morning
in the street to the stray dogs which
selected him for a master on account of
his smile. Most of all he was good to
us, his grandchildren, and hardly a day
passed by that granddad Lawrence did
not come walking in to hear the news.
There were no children at his own house,
for Auntie May was growing into a
young lady, and granddad Lawrence
liked children, being a child himself at
heart, with all a child's love of mischief.
But to the friends who trusted in him,
he was the soul of loyalty, in thought
as well as in word.</p>

<p>When he went home I walked out to
the hall door with him, as I always did,
and then we had what he called a mercantile
transaction. He bent down low,
and patted his pocket.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't you want to draw on the
bank?" he asked, invitingly.</p>

<p>I ran my hand far into the depths
of that jingling pocket. I could have
whatever I liked, but the little brass
pennies were the prettiest, and the cute
little silver ten-cent pieces, which seemed
especially made for children.</p>

<p>"Draw again," he said, generously.
"Now give the cashier a kiss."</p>

<p>I did not kiss him for pennies. I
kissed him for pure love.</p>

<p>"Come again, dear granddad," I said,
standing at the door to peep after him.
"Come again to-morrow."</p>

<p>He waved his hand to me.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Hottentot," he called,
mischievously.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," I answered, in rather a
plaintive voice.</p>

<p>I did not think that I liked my new
name.</p>

<p>That was the first occasion on which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
I heard of my music lessons, but not the
last. My mother seemed to take wonderfully
to the idea. She was always
discussing the things that she meant us
to learn, but up to then we had been
too small for any of her plans to be of
much importance. To take music lessons
was a very simple matter. It could
not be considered work, but play on a
larger scale; and after I had slipped
into the parlor, and touched the piano
keys with a timorous finger, I knew that
I should like it. The keys were voices.
When grown-up people touched them,
they sang together beautifully. There
was one which was a fairy queen, and
one which was a prince, and one away
down in the lower bass made me tremble
when it talked. That was an ogre. I
thought that he might eat little children.
I ran out of the parlor in a hurry for
fear that he should catch me. Something
pattered up the stairs behind me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
and chased me along the hall, but in my
mother's room not even an ogre would
dare to come.</p>

<p>"She loves music!" my mother cried.
"She is always hanging around the
piano."</p>

<p>Grandmother looked at me curiously.</p>

<p>"There has never been a musician in
our family," she remarked, in a dubious
way.</p>

<p>"I played before I was married," my
mother answered. "There doesn't seem
to be any time for it now."</p>

<p>She sighed a little as she spoke.</p>

<p>Her lap was full of pretty new cloth
which she was making into dresses, and
one of the twins was riding on the
rockers of her chair, and one was whistling,
shrilly. My mother rocked slowly
that there might not be an accident.
Most people would have thought that
she was only a mother, but at that precise
moment she was, also, an express<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
train coming into a station, and I was
a passenger waiting to get aboard.</p>

<p>"I think I'll get Madame Tomaso to
give Rhoda lessons," she said. "We
might as well have the best teacher in
town. Dad had the best for me when
I was a child. It is the first step which
always counts."</p>

<p>The whistle sounded again, and two
passengers climbed into the rocker behind
my mother's back. We were a
very tight fit for the chair. She sat a
little forward in a meek way, so as to
make room for our toes, and rocked
more slowly. The train was going uphill
carrying a heavy load.</p>

<p>When she was consulted on the subject,
Madame Tomaso proved to be very
glad to give me lessons. For some reason
or other it had been a poor season
for her, either because there were only
a few little girls musically inclined in
the town, or because, which seems more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
probable, she had a name for severity.
She appeared very amiable, however,
the first morning that she entered our
house. She drew me to her, with quite
a motherly hand, when I came bashfully
into the parlor to meet her.</p>

<p>"So this is the small Miss," she said,
in a terrifying voice like the ogre's.
"And she loves the music? It is well."</p>

<p>She shook hands with me very hard.
She had on a dress trimmed with bits
of black glass,&mdash;I always hated jet
afterwards,&mdash;and a red silk collar which
exactly matched the hearty red in her
cheeks. Her hair was black, and her
eyes were black. I did not quite like
the way that she looked at me. I wondered
if she ate little children.</p>

<p>"She is so bright," my mother declared,
fondly, pushing the hair back
from my forehead. "Stand up straight,
Rhoda. You will find that she learns
very quickly, Madame Tomaso."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>"So?" the ogress answered, in an
absent manner.</p>

<p>She was looking at the piano-stool
and at me. She was evidently wild to
begin, and had not much time to spare
for motherly confidences.</p>

<p>"I am afraid that she might fall off
the stool," my mother said, hurriedly.
"Couldn't you use a chair, Madame
Tomaso? Though the chairs are rather
low for such a little girl."</p>

<p>They made a chair higher with a big
book and a sofa pillow, and set me on
top in front of the fascinating white
keys. The twins were peeping in the
door. I looked back at them grandly.
I felt very old and important. It
seemed almost impossible that only that
morning we had been playing express
trains together, like children! Still,
there was something about it which
frightened me, notwithstanding my
pride.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go away!" I whispered, warningly,
to the figures at the door.</p>

<p>They went quickly in evident alarm.
Even Dick did not stop for a second
look.</p>

<p>"Will she hurt sister?" Trixie asked,
in a high voice, as they climbed upstairs.</p>

<p>Dick peered between the banisters.</p>

<p>"If she does, I'll shoot her," he declared,
stoutly.</p>

<p>I was glad to see them escape, but I
did not like it quite so well when my
mother followed them, and the door was
tightly closed. I had such a trapped
feeling. And the pillow was so high
that I could not get down without help.
Anything might happen! Madame Tomaso
yawned a little as she settled down
by my side, but she was still kind. She
put a paper in front of me which was
covered with black scratches.</p>

<p>"Which is 'a'?" she asked, sociably,
pointing to a row of things.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>"'A' was an Archer who shot at a
Frog," I recited, in a timid whisper.</p>

<p>The twins and I had learned that out
of a pink book with blue edges. The
archer was dressed in red, and the
frog was green with yellow trimmings.
I could, also, say the catechism from
cover to cover, if she would like to
hear that, and Who Killed Cock Robin.
I had never supposed that anybody
but my mother cared for such things.
She loved to have us say them to
her.</p>

<p>"And 'b'?" Madame Tomaso inquired,
staring.</p>

<p>"'B' was a Butcher who had a big
Dog," I went on, with growing confidence.</p>

<p>I did not feel nearly so frightened
now. She was rather nice. If I were
very good, maybe she would not eat me
after all.</p>

<p>"Don't you know your letters?" she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
demanded, in astonishment. "Don't
you go to school?"</p>

<p>"No," I answered, sadly. "I am not
strong."</p>

<p>"Ah! Bah!" she cried, in a rude way.</p>

<p>I was sure, perfectly sure, that even
a Hottentot would never have said that.</p>

<p>Madame Tomaso taught me my letters
that morning, at least the first
seven of them, which seemed particularly
needed in music. She called for
a bottle of ink, and wrote their names
on the white keys. She was very patient
with me, as I afterwards found
out when I was no longer a new pupil
to be coaxed along the thorny path.
She put each finger where it belonged,
and once, when I played five notes without
any trouble, she went down through
a rent in her skirt which was fastened
together with safety-pins, and fished me
out a caramel from a hidden pocket. It
was very old and hard, and looked as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
if it had seen much service, but she regarded
me with a benevolent expression
while I ate it, and I felt that we had
made a good beginning. Take it altogether,
I thought that I liked music,
and I practiced for hours. It was a
great deal of fun when Madame Tomaso
was not there, for then I did it all with
one finger, which made it much easier.
As my feet hung in the air, the twins
worked the pedals for me, and my
mother would come into the parlor with
a pleased smile, and fix the curtains so
that I might have a good light.</p>

<p>"That child will surely be a musician,"
I heard her tell my father, in an eager
way. "I've promised her a ring the
day that she can play the Tr&auml;umerei.
It may take a long time, but then she
practices <i>so</i> faithfully!"</p>

<p>My father groaned. I think my
mother slapped him.</p>

<p>Of all the family it was, perhaps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Norah who was the most delighted with
my lessons. She took a very friendly
interest in them. She always dusted the
parlor when I was there practicing, and
she would sometimes put down a big
finger herself on the piano keys in an
experimental way, and jump when they
sounded. There was only one thing
about my music which worried Norah,
and that was the fact that I knew no
tunes.</p>

<p>"Sure it's time that you were learning
something," she would say, suspiciously.
"Ain't she keeping you back?
Can't you play 'The Wearing of the
Green' yit?"</p>

<p>"No," I answered, humbly.</p>

<p>"You ought to have an Irish teacher,"
she said, conclusively. "Madame Tomaso!
It's a cat's name that she has!
I never could abide them foreigners."</p>

<p>"Listen, Norah," I urged.</p>

<p>Very carefully, very slowly, with one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
finger and infinite pains, I played
"Home, Sweet Home" for her. She
burst into tears, and throwing her arms
around my neck, rocked back and forth
with grief. For a moment I thought
that I had hurt her feelings, but it was
all right. Norah was only homesick for
old Ireland. She was paying me the
highest compliment that I ever received.</p>

<p>Little by little Madame Tomaso came
to treat me differently. The coaxing
voice grew gruff, and the black eyes
savage. No more caramels came out of
the rent in her skirt, and sometimes I
almost fancied that she was scolding me!
I was very little to be scolded. No one
had done that before. I tried harder
than ever to please her. I practiced
with two fingers, and, at last, even with
three, one very heavy in the bass, and
two very shaky in the treble. I did not
tell anybody about the things which she
said, for I was ashamed, but I imagined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
that granddad suspected. Granddad
was always so sharp. It was a
wonderful comfort to hide my face on
his shoulder, and be petted. He was
sorry for me without my saying a single
word. He made me draw on the bank
every day, and he confided to me all the
troubles which he had had when he was
a boy.</p>

<p>Once he told me of an awful thing
that he did. He puffed out his cheeks
before he began to talk, so I knew that
it was going to be funny.</p>

<p>"I didn't get on well with a maid
my mother had," he said. "Her name
was Polly. Did I ever tell you about
Polly, Rhoda?"</p>

<p>"No, granddad," I answered, eagerly.</p>

<p>I was leaning against his chair, and
we had the parlor quite to ourselves. It
was a time for confidences.</p>

<p>"Polly didn't like boys," granddad
went on.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>"But she liked you, granddad," I asserted,
loyally.</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"Polly liked me least of all. She may
have had her reasons, but it was her
fault in the first place, mind you.
When I'd bring home a poor stray
dog, she would turn it out to starve!
And when I brought home stones, and
I was always fond of stones, she would
dump them out in the road. I felt
that I should like to get even."</p>

<p>I nodded at him. I had felt that way
myself.</p>

<p>"So I got a lot of pepper, and one
day when Polly was going to sweep I
scattered it around the house. I rubbed
it well into the carpets."</p>

<p>He scraped his foot over the floor
to show me just how he did it. For
the moment he looked about ten years
old.</p>

<p>"I rubbed it in quite hard. It didn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
show. Nobody could tell that there was
anything wrong until she began to
sweep. Well, Rhoda, if you could have
heard her sneeze, it would have done
you good. She sneezed for hours. At
first they thought that Polly had a new
kind of sickness. They went flying for
the doctor; but my mother had noticed
me laugh, and she pounced on me. She
shook the truth out of me."</p>

<p>He trembled with laughter at the
recollection.</p>

<p>"But what did they do to you, granddad?"
I asked, breathlessly.</p>

<p>Sometimes his story would have an
anticlimax.</p>

<p>"They put me down in the big black
cellar," he declared, impressively.</p>

<p>I rubbed my head against his shoulder.
I felt that I could never have
treated him in that way if I had been
his mother.</p>

<p>"Poor granddad," I said, in a consoling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
whisper. "They were not good to
you!"</p>

<p>He puffed out his cheeks, and his
eyes shone.</p>

<p>"That depends," he said, cheerfully.
"I didn't mind, bless you. We lived
in the country, and they kept their pies
in the cellar."</p>

<p>"Yes?" I questioned, eagerly.</p>

<p>"That night when they took stock
they were short three pies."</p>

<p>"Oh!" I gasped.</p>

<p>I gazed at him in indecision. He
looked back at me quite gravely, save
for a lurking twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>"Did you eat them, granddad?" I
asked, confidentially.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"And twenty doughnuts," he said.</p>

<p>I regarded him with deep admiration.
What a dreadful bad boy dear granddad
had been!</p>

<p>I used often to wish that Madame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Tomaso had granddad to deal with. I
did not think that she would be so cross,
or, at least, she would not show it so
openly. She had a trick of frowning
until her eyebrows grew together in one
thick, black line. She would frown and
beat time, and I would chase after her
on the piano, with a blur before my
eyes, and my heart in my mouth. Sometimes
we arrived at a bar together, both
out of breath; sometimes she left me
far behind, very weak and miserable,
with stumbling fingers which refused to
hurry. She always beat time with a
large black fan, and when the chase
proved exhaustive, she would open the
fan, and fan herself even in the depth
of winter. While she fanned herself she
would say things to me, unkind things.</p>

<p>Once she told me about her other
pupils.</p>

<p>"I have ten," she said, "ten little
girls. Some of them do not make good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
music. <i>I rap them over the fingers with
my fan!</i>"</p>

<p>She went on for quite awhile relating
long stories of raps inflicted upon helpless
little girls, some of whom had actually
been saucy to her, and some of
whom had merely played false notes like
myself. A much larger girl than I had
been rapped that very morning for false
notes, and had cried! Afterwards she
had played a great deal better.</p>

<p>I listened in growing terror. I wondered
if she were trying to frighten me.
Then suddenly I glanced up at my
great-grandfather's picture.</p>

<p>The parlor walls were hung with the
pictures of men who had borne my name.
Most of them had preached, but some
had fought; and he, my great-grandfather,
who looked down over the piano,
had preached with a sword in his hand.
All the Harcourts had been brave men.
They had never been afraid of anything.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
And on the other side there was granddad
Lawrence, whose courage no one
could possibly question. He would not
have stood this when he was a boy. Just
think of Polly!</p>

<p>Something inside of me seemed to
awake. I turned and faced her, ogress
though she was.</p>

<p>"You'll never rap mine," I said,
steadily. "Never! I am bad! I am a
Hottentot!"</p>

<p>I made a horrid face at her, such as
a Hottentot might be supposed to have.</p>

<p>For the first and only time in the
course of our acquaintance she laughed.
She laughed as if she would die, while
I sat on my sofa pillow and watched
her. During the rest of the lesson she
was remarkably friendly.</p>

<p>My mother was much pleased with
the progress that I made. She often
spoke of Madame Tomaso's method,
and of how brilliantly her little pupils<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
played. My mother had never heard
of raps. All the family were encouraging
in their comments, and they, also,
set me a shining example. My mother
rubbed up her musical knowledge, and
even my grandmother would steal into
the parlor in the early twilight, and
play some Old World melody which held
within its tune the hurry of dancing feet.
All these I was to learn some day, when
my fingers had grown as strong as my
desire. I played better and better for
the admiring circle, until Madame Tomaso
herself would have been astonished
if she could have heard me.</p>

<p>"She really does quite well," my father
said one night. "It almost sounds like
a tune. Is it 'Yankee Doodle,' or 'Old
Dog Tray'?"</p>

<p>"Neither!" my mother cried, warmly.
"I don't know exactly what it is myself,
but it is probably something classic.
And she is doing it beautifully!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is 'Yankee Doodle,' mother," I
said, in a whisper.</p>

<p>She did not hear me. She was looking
at the piano with sad eyes.</p>

<p>"They have taken an awful lot
out of it," she said. "It was the first
thing that we bought after we were
married!"</p>

<p>"Was it?" my father inquired,
briskly. "I thought we bought the
coffee-pot first. Didn't we fry eggs in
the coffee-pot?"</p>

<p>My mother gave him a startled glance.</p>

<p>"We did fry eggs in a coffee-pot,"
she admitted, reluctantly. "At
least <i>you</i> fried them. I did not know
how."</p>

<p>"Somehow eggs don't taste as good
now-a-days as those did," my father said,
musingly. "I wonder if it was the
coffee-pot."</p>

<p>Grandmother leant over my shoulder,
and examined the piano cover.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>"What made that, Rhoda?" she demanded,
pointing to a broad streak which
ran through the plush.</p>

<p>"That is where Madame Tomaso beats
time," I answered, meekly.</p>

<p>They looked at one another.</p>

<p>"She is such an excellent teacher," my
mother said, apologetically, "that I suppose
I ought not to complain. It's very
good of her to take so much trouble.
Just as soon as they are large enough,
she shall teach the twins, too."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, mother!" I cried, quickly.</p>

<p>"Why not, Rhoda?"</p>

<p>I evaded the question.</p>

<p>"Couldn't I teach them, mother?" I
asked, anxiously.</p>

<p>They all laughed at me as if I had said
something foolish.</p>

<p>It was evident that I should never get
rid of Madame Tomaso. She would
come year after year, forever and ever,
until I and the twins were quite grown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
up. The twins were little and easily
frightened. She would make them cry.
I knew that she would. Sometimes, although
I was such a big girl, she almost
made me cry, when she beat time and
shouted, for she was beginning to shout.
And that last scene, though I had been
victorious, had rankled. I felt that my
mother would be highly indignant if I
told her, but somehow I could not tell
her. There did not seem to be any way
out. I looked at the piano cover, and
thought and thought.</p>

<p>"Granddad," I inquired next day,
"what became of Polly?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Polly left," he answered.</p>

<p>"Right away, granddad?" I demanded,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Just as soon as she could get her
trunk packed. Why?"</p>

<p>I rubbed my head against his shoulder
without replying.</p>

<p>He did not ask any more questions, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
he looked at me, keenly. He slipped his
hand under my chin, and forced me to
meet his eyes. I could never hide my
thoughts from anybody. And granddad
was always so horribly sharp! He
chuckled a little as he gazed at me.
When he went away he made me draw
largely on the bank, and he patted me
on the head.</p>

<p>"Keep up your courage," he whispered.
"You're game!"</p>

<p>Out in the hall I heard him ask my
mother a sudden question.</p>

<p>"When does Madame Tomaso come
again?" he inquired, suavely.</p>

<p>It was always on Tuesdays that Madame
Tomaso came, and it was strange
how Tuesdays raced around. That
Tuesday, in particular, arrived almost in
a moment while I was still thinking.
But I had made my preparations.</p>

<p>"You are very careless about the casters,
Norah," my mother said at breakfast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
"There is actually no pepper on
the table."</p>

<p>"But I filled them last night, ma'am!"
Norah cried, staring.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that they all turned
and looked at me. I slipped from the
room in a hurry. Somehow I felt so
queer that morning. I kept sighing, and
when the door-bell rang I would get
quite cold all over. It rang a great many
times before Madame Tomaso came,
fresh and alert from her walk, with an
air of friendliness which was always sure
to disappear later. She turned cross very
early that day, even before she had taken
off her things.</p>

<p>"I have been too lenient with you,
little Miss," she told me, in an awful
voice. "We will try a new method."</p>

<p>She seated herself by the piano, and
folded her arms. I sat perched on my
cushion, and stared at her in fascination.
Oh, how I wished that I had let the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
pepper alone! Oh, how I wished that
I was good! After all it was so pleasant
to be good.</p>

<p>"Play," she said, in a masterful manner.
"I will be an audience. I will be a
great many mens and womens. We will
listen to you."</p>

<p>I played. It was very terrible. Her
eyebrows grew together. That was the
way she would look when she found me
out, only worse, much worse. I played
faster. She watched my notes, and sometimes
she would moan, feebly, as if
something hurt her. I played on faster
still, one trembling little hand racing
ahead of the other, until musical flesh and
blood could stand it no longer. She
began to count with a shout.</p>

<p>"One, two, three, four!" she cried,
and brought the fan down on the piano
cover.</p>

<p>Then she sneezed.</p>

<p>"I knew it," she murmured, grimly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
to herself. "I felt it coming on this
morning!"</p>

<p>She counted again and sneezed, and I
sneezed a little myself in a hurried, guilty
way. She looked at me with sudden
suspicion. She was sharp, almost as
sharp as granddad. In a second she had
lifted the piano cover, and found a pile
of pepper under that well-worn spot.
The things which she said were awful.
She said them in three or four languages,
and she said them in such a high voice
that my mother and grandmother came
running in alarm. She pointed at me,
with a shaking finger.</p>

<p>"Look at your child," she cried. "She
lays traps for me! Pepper traps!"</p>

<p>"Rhoda!" my mother exclaimed.</p>

<p>My grandmother seemed stricken
dumb.</p>

<p>I hung my head in shame. I had forgotten
how sorry they would be.</p>

<p>She told them all about it. She knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
just why I had done it, and how I had
done it. She declared that she would
never give me another lesson. No, never!
Her voice grew very loud in her denunciation,
and the mild words of shocked
apology which my mother put in from
time to time were swept away in the torrent
of her wrath. I saw my grandmother's
lip curl, and my mother look
astonished. They were judging her by
their own standards of quiet reticence
and womanly dignity. She was almost
justifying me.</p>

<p>Yet before she went she lodged an
arrow in my mother's heart.</p>

<p>"As for the child's talent," she cried,
and snapped her fingers. "It would be
as easy to teach her the tight-rope!"</p>

<p>I heard somebody laugh in the next
room. It sounded just like granddad.</p>

<p>My mother and my grandmother went
to the door with Madame Tomaso, and
saw her out quite as if she were company,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
and then they came back into the parlor
and gazed at me. They did not seem to
know just what to say. It was evident
that I had done something dreadful. I
began to be frightened. We had a big
black cellar, with dark, cavernous recesses
where cobwebs swayed about, and
dwarfs peeped out at you. I wished
that it was night, and I was safe in my
bed.</p>

<p>Then somebody shuffled in behind me,
and patted my head softly. I looked up
into two merry blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Don't you fret, Rhoda," a sympathizing
voice said. "Granddad will stand
by you."</p>

<p>Even now when he is only a memory I
can still feel the thrill of gratitude with
which I clung to his protecting hand.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<div class="unindent1">"<span class="smcap">But</span> she hasn't any dress!" my
mother cried, in consternation. "Only
that white Sunday one which is much
too short!"</div>

<p>"Let down a tuck," my grandmother
said, decisively. "That would lengthen
it."</p>

<p>"Oh, do let down a tuck, mother!"
I echoed, eagerly.</p>

<p>I had a little pink envelope hugged
up close against my apron. On the outside
it had "Miss Rhoda Harcourt"
written in very large letters, and on the
inside it invited me to a party! I was
not quite sure what people did at a party;
but I knew it must be something delightful,
judging from the commotion the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
pink envelope made in the family.
There was a whirlwind of talk about
white dresses, and new slippers, and blue
bows, and in the midst of the discussion
Auntie May caught up her dress and
danced.</p>

<p>"Come here, Rhoda," she called.
"This is what they do at a party. Come.
I will teach you how."</p>

<p>I braced my back, stiffly, and let her
haul me around. This was a serious matter,
and must be undertaken with a sober
mind.</p>

<p>"She hasn't any spring in her,"
Auntie May exclaimed, ruefully. "Who
would think that she is related to
me!"</p>

<p>"She does not come of a dancing
family," my grandmother replied, with
a cold smile. "The Harcourts look after
their souls, and let their feet alone."</p>

<p>Auntie May made a wry face. She
was my mother's sister.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't shut up like a knife, Rhoda,"
she said, disconsolately. "Let yourself
go. There, I believe the Lawrence side
of the family is waking up at last!"</p>

<p>She looked so pretty as she danced in
the firelight that I tried to be like her. I
copied her courtesies, and followed her
steps, and when, at length, she fell
breathlessly into a chair, I leaned against
her knee with my hand on her pink
cheek.</p>

<p>"Auntie May, are you going, too?" I
asked, confidentially.</p>

<p>Somehow I thought it would be rather
nice to have Auntie May there, just for
company.</p>

<p>"Child!" she cried, with a grand air,
"it's a children's party. I am sixteen!"</p>

<p>I felt the rebuke. I was only seven
myself, and there were whole centuries
between us. It was strange, though,
how sometimes Auntie May would play
with my dolls, and sometimes she would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
tuck up her hair and keep me at arm's
length. I never knew which she was
going to be&mdash;little girl or grown
woman.</p>

<p>Auntie May did not live with us, but
in another house with a lady who called
herself my frivolous grandmother, and
curled her hair every day of her life.
Grandmother Harcourt wore sober black
silk dresses, but this other grandmother
liked blue and pink, and even sometimes
a gallant touch of red that made her look
almost young again. Whenever she
looked her youngest, she was greatly
pleased, and curled her hair triumphantly.
At family meetings the two
grandmothers often made those curls the
subject for discussion, and oftener still it
was my dress and manners which never
seemed to suit either of them. One
wanted me very quiet and subdued, and
dressed in gingham, and the other wanted
me very gay and lively, and dressed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
silk. As grandmother Harcourt lived
in our house, she had the advantage, and,
save for occasional bursts of splendor, I
went in great meekness of spirit and
dress.</p>

<p>I had thought at first that there was
going to be trouble about the party.
My frivolous grandmother objected seriously
to the idea of that tuck. She
seemed to think that I should look very
shabby among the other little girls. She
spoke of her position, and of the great
pleasure that it would give her to buy me
a dress.</p>

<p>"Nellie," she urged, almost with tears
in her eyes, "let me buy Rhoda a suitable
dress. You surely don't want that unfortunate
child to go to the Otway's with
a tuck let down!"</p>

<p>Grandmother Harcourt did not say
anything. I fancy that she must have
had it all arranged beforehand, for, after
a rather appealing look at her, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
mother declined the offer in a faint,
reluctant voice.</p>

<p>I did not care what I wore. I was
going to a party. That was enough for
me. All the night before I could not
sleep, and when, at last, the hour drew
near, and I stood before my mother while
she gave a final touch to my floating hair,
I felt that it was all a dream. It was a
dream going down the stairs while the
twins, in their nightgowns, peeped after
me, and it was a dream getting into the
carriage which Auntie May had brought
to take me. The very streets were a
dream, with little white-clad girls passing
in our direction and little boys, with
stiff white collars and solemn faces, walking
along behind them. And most of all
that big house on the hill was a dream,
with the lights shining in all its windows,
and the rows of Chinese lanterns in the
piazza, and a nearby violin letting off
cheerful notes of preparation.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mrs. Otway is giving this party
for the two little grandchildren who
are visiting her," Auntie May said,
peering out of the carriage window.
"They come from the city. They are
cousins. You saw them in church on
Sunday."</p>

<p>So that was who they were! I felt
that I had learned something. Only the
Sunday before there had come into the
pew before me, first a little boy, and
then a little girl, followed by a party of
ladies. The little boy sat up in the far
end of the pew, just as I did, and he had
a high silk hat laid on the cushion beside
him, and an elegant cane with a silver
head to which he seemed much attached.
I never noticed little boys as a rule. I
divided them into two classes: boys who
walked clumsily, in heavy boots, and
glanced sidewise at me, and <i>bad</i> boys
who made awful faces from behind trees.
Never to one of them had I said a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
word. That boy, however, was something
quite different. I knew that as
soon as I looked at him. He had a light
graceful figure, and brave, beautiful
eyes. When he gazed over his shoulder
and smiled at me, I felt strangely
pleased. It was as though some one
whom I had known a long time ago had
come again.</p>

<p>"Oh, so <i>he</i> is Theodore Otway!" I
cried, unguardedly, remembering the
name on my pink invitation.</p>

<p>Auntie May laughed a whole minute,
just about nothing at all.</p>

<p>"You get down here, Rhoda," she
said. "Now, remember to shake out
your hair the way that I showed you.
And don't you get frightened as you
always do. Your dress isn't very fine;
but there is one thing that is nice about
it. It has real lace basted in the neck.
Mother put it in. Just fancy, grandmother
Harcourt never noticed! Always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
give your right hand first in the
ladies' chain. You are the only little girl
who has come in a carriage. Oh, dear
me, I wish that it wasn't a children's
party! I'd just love to go in! The
lovely, lovely music! What shall you do,
Rhoda, if you get very frightened?"</p>

<p>"I'll shut my eyes, and think that I'm
in church," I answered, soberly.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" I heard her cry as
the carriage drove away, "there's the
other side of the family coming out after
all!"</p>

<p>I went up the steps rather breathlessly.
There was a big lump rising in
my throat, as if I had run miles and miles.
I wondered if they would let me in, or
if I would have to say what my name
was. I was not real sure in my mind that
I knew what my name was. Once, years
ago, I had been called Rhoda, but Rhoda
always went to bed at seven o'clock.
This was a new little girl, a fairy child,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
who walked under globes of fire straight
into fairy-land.</p>

<p>Up, up, I went, past a man with shining
buttons who held the door open very
graciously for me, past shrubs and
flowers banked along the staircase, into
a room where there was a great hum of
voices. Ever so many little girls, dozens
of them, were taking off their hats, and
shaking out their skirts, and doing what
grandmother called "prinking" before
a great glass. I prinked a little myself,
following out Auntie May's directions. I
thought that I looked rather nice. A
woman in a white cap seemed to think
so, too. She took a great deal of pains
with me, and when the other little girls,
who knew one another, went down the
stairs in a group, she led me by the hand
to the staircase, and showed me where
to go.</p>

<p>It was very hard to walk down the
stairs alone. I had such a queer feeling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
and I could not see a thing for a mist
before my eyes.  I went quite slowly,
step by step. I could hear the people
in the parlor talking.</p>

<p>A lady said, "How pretty!" and a
boy's voice cried, "Here she is! Here
she is, at last!"</p>

<p>Then in a moment some one was shaking
my hand. Little by little the mist
cleared from before my eyes, and I saw
that I was at the party.</p>

<p>The parlor was a long room, running
the whole length of the house, but it
looked crowded that night. There were
groups of little girls, all those whom I
had seen upstairs, and more besides, and
lots and lots of little boys who stood in
corners and laughed among themselves.
There were lights on the walls and
flowers everywhere, and the few grown-up
people who moved about seemed just
as gay and festive as the children. By
the door were stationed Theodore Otway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
and his cousin, and she had on a lovely
pink dress with cascades of little bows
falling down her back. All the grown-up
ladies seemed to watch her, and when
she pranced and shook her bows I heard
a lady say, "Paris!" in an awed tone.</p>

<p>There was such a hubbub everywhere
that I did not notice at first that a boy,
whom I had never seen before, was writing
his name on my programme. He
was quite a stout boy in tight clothes.</p>

<p>"I'll take this first one, just to make
sure," he said. "Maybe, after awhile,
I'll dance with you again. Don't you
forget what I look like."</p>

<p>"No," I answered, humbly.</p>

<p>"That's right," he continued, patronizingly.
"What's your name?"</p>

<p>I told him in a bashful whisper.</p>

<p>"Well, you want to watch out, and
when I holler 'Rhoda' you come where
I am. That will be when the music
strikes up. Don't forget."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," I said again.</p>

<p>"If you are not there, I might take
some other girl," he remarked, as a final
caution.</p>

<p>Theodore Otway was going by, led by
a lady. She was arguing seriously with
him.</p>

<p>"Of course you must dance the first
dance with your cousin!" I heard her cry.
"I told you yesterday that you must.
You can ask the little girl some other
time."</p>

<p>He gave me a miserable glance as he
went to the other end of the room.</p>

<p>I hardly noticed him. I was so worried
over the stout boy, who roved about
the room, here and there and everywhere.
Once he hid behind a sofa, and once he
went out in the hall to get a drink of
lemonade. He unbuttoned his jacket,
and tried to make himself look different
by crossing his eyes. I was sure that he
did. And, just when the music struck up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
he disappeared altogether! The other
little girls all had partners. I was the
only one left out. I felt it very keenly.</p>

<p>Suddenly I heard some one shout,
"Rhoda!"</p>

<p>I turned around, and there he was behind
my chair, where he had been standing
all the time.</p>

<p>"Come along," he said, just as if it
were my fault, although there was a look
of elation about him. "If you don't
hurry up, we won't get in the top set.
That's the nicest of all."</p>

<p>I followed him, meekly. I was very
glad to find him again, but I felt an inward
conviction that I should never get
used to boys.</p>

<p>It was not hard to dance. Somehow it
was more fun than it had been at home
with Auntie May. I always remembered
to give my right hand first in the ladies'
chain, and when I met my partner I courtesied
to him every time. I did not forget<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
a single thing! The music was very
lively, and everybody was smiling, even
the grown-up people at the other end of
the room who danced and romped among
themselves. I thought that I should like
to go on forever, back and forth, and in
and out in the ladies' chain. I wished that
the music would never stop, but it did, at
last, with a sudden chord, and we were
all ready for something else.</p>

<p>It was a game this time, a strange, new
game called "Post-office." It began by
a little girl leaving the room, mysteriously,
and calling a little boy out into the
hall to receive a letter.</p>

<p>"There's a letter in the post-office for
Davie Williams," she cried, in a shrill,
high voice that sounded frightened.</p>

<p>All the other little girls laughed.
Davie Williams grew very red in the face,
but he went out for his letter, and closed
the door carefully behind him.</p>

<p>I wondered why he stayed so long, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
what they could possibly be doing behind
the door. It was very exciting. Suppose,
just suppose, that there should be
a letter for me! More little girls went
out, and more little boys. The girls
tossed their heads, and the boys went
quickly, as though to get it over. One
boy called out another boy instead of a
little girl, and was laughed at. I did
not think that I should like to be laughed
at. Then Theodore Otway went out
and I heard my name.</p>

<p>He was waiting for me with his hands
in his pockets.</p>

<p>"Hello," he said, in a diffident way.</p>

<p>"Hello," I answered, shyly fingering
my hair.</p>

<p>I looked about for the wonderful something
which I had come to see. There
was nothing, only the hall and Theodore
Otway still with his hands in his pockets.
Strange to say he seemed embarrassed.
He fidgeted. He talked in jerks.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>"I saw you in church," he said,
suddenly.</p>

<p>I nodded at him.</p>

<p>"I saw you, too," I confessed, with a
shamefaced smile.</p>

<p>He came a step nearer, and hesitated.</p>

<p>"Say," he said, "I don't live in this
house when I'm home."</p>

<p>"No?" I answered, inquiringly.</p>

<p>"No," he replied, seriously.</p>

<p>We were both silent. There did not
seem to be anything more to talk about.
Still it was rather nice out in the hall.</p>

<p>Somebody rattled the knob. Evidently
our turn was over.</p>

<p>"Who's going to take you out to
supper?" he asked, with sudden interest.</p>

<p>"I don't know," I answered.</p>

<p>"Well, let me take you, won't you?
You'd better. There's a boy here who
plays tricks on little girls!"</p>

<p>I shivered. Was it the stout boy?</p>

<p>"Once he made a little girl cry out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
loud at a party! You'd better. Will
you? Say yes."</p>

<p>He came a little closer. He put out
his hand, and touched my hair.</p>

<p>"It's like sunshine!" he cried, with a
burst of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>I stole a shy glance at him. Nobody
had ever told me that before.</p>

<p>"Say yes!" he begged, in a new tone.</p>

<p>"Yes," I whispered, hiding my face
behind my hair.</p>

<p>Somebody rattled the knob again.
They were growing impatient.</p>

<p>"Well, good-bye," he said, in a hurried
way. His hands were back in his pockets.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," I answered.</p>

<p>He went toward the door, then turned
again, as if he had forgotten something,
and stood thinking.</p>

<p>"Will you give me that?" he asked,
pointing to a wee blue bow on my sleeve.</p>

<p>I unpinned it, and laid it in his hand.
He fastened it to the front of his coat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
He strutted a little as he went into the
parlor. I could see by his smile that he
was pleased.</p>

<p>It was my turn now, and I must call a
little boy, for that was what all the girls
did. I looked in the parlor, undecidedly.
There was the stout boy going by with a
cheerful wink, and away in the back of
the room a nice little fairhaired boy
named Eddie was watching me, wistfully.
I called Eddie, with sudden fearlessness.
He came with a rush, and
closed the door behind him. Then he
kissed me before I could say a single
word! I pushed him away, and began to
cry. Even through my bitter tears I
could see his astonished face. How was
he to know that all my life I had hated
to be kissed by strangers. And now by
a boy!</p>

<p>"Why, that's the game!" he cried,
eagerly. "What did you call me out
for?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know," I answered, sobbing.</p>

<p>He gazed at me with a worried look.
Then he pulled out a fat, white lozenge
from his vest pocket, and offered it
to me.</p>

<p>"Here, take that," he said, generously.</p>

<p>I examined it through my tears with
strong disfavor. It looked like medicine.
Still I did not want to hurt his feelings.
I ate it with misgivings.</p>

<p>"That's right," he said, radiantly.
"They are good for sore throat. My
father takes them. Don't you feel better
now?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered, with a weak smile.</p>

<p>It was evident that in his way he meant
to be kind, and, perhaps, after all the
lozenge like the kiss might be a part of
the game.</p>

<p>They were dancing in the parlor when
we went back, and the fun was growing
loud and furious. One little girl was
singing, rapturously, as she danced, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
two little boys were sliding in a corner.
There was talk of supper. Somebody,
peeking through a keyhole, had seen pink
ice-cream, and had come away dazzled.
The great hour was drawing near, and
little boys were going about looking for
their partners. Up at the end of the
room Theodore's mother was talking to
him.</p>

<p>He came to me afterwards, with a
crest-fallen air:</p>

<p>"Say," he said, "I can't take you out
to supper. I have to take my cousin.
She says so."</p>

<p>He looked back over his shoulder,
threateningly.</p>

<p>"What she says now, goes. When
I'm a man things will be different.
Ain't you sorry I can't take you
out?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I confessed, candidly.</p>

<p>He seemed to be glad that I should be
sorry.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>"He's going to take you out," he continued,
with a jealous nod at the stout
boy. "She asked him to."</p>

<p>I did not want to go with the stout
boy. Every time that he looked sidewise
at me I felt a sudden fear. Suppose that
it should be a trick! Suppose that he
should think of something new to do
right now! When the inspiring march
began, however, and we all fell into line,
each little girl on the arm of her partner,
I forgot everything in my excitement,
and grew almost reconciled.</p>

<p>We passed solemnly around the parlor
three times, and then swept across the
hall into an opposite room. In the center
of the room there stood a beautiful table,
and the woman in the white cap, who was
the only grown person in sight, was serving
out pink ice-cream. The little girls
sat on chairs about the walls, and the
little boys brought them plates full of
goodies from the table. There were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
lovely things which I had never seen
before, much too pretty to eat, and almost
too fragile to touch. And over the
whole room there fell the soft light of
candles.</p>

<p>"Do you like ice-cream?" the stout
boy asked, when he had seen me settled
in my chair. "I tell you what I'll
do. I'll pick out all the things that I
like."</p>

<p>He was a wonderful provider. I could
see him heaping up my plate, and he always
seemed to take the best of everything.
No other girl was going to have
such mammoth slices of cake as I, and he
had a perfect pyramid of candy in his
hand. I knew that I could never eat it
all, no, not a half. Somehow he did not
seem able to find me afterwards. I
beckoned to him, but still he turned aside,
and went toward a far corner. He was
sitting down! He was going to eat the
things himself! Was it a trick? I looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
down hard in my lap. Never, no, never,
should he make <i>me</i> cry out loud at a
party!</p>

<p>I heard a sudden sound of wrath. I
turned around just in time to see Theodore
Otway tip the stout boy over on the
floor, and sit on him. He seemed to be
very angry. He pounded the stout boy.
I was almost afraid to look. The woman
in the white cap left off serving pink ice-cream,
and made a dreadful outcry.</p>

<p>"Oh, Master Theodore," she cried,
wringing her hands. "Oh, Master Theodore!
You mustn't do that! It's not
polite!"</p>

<p>A little boy cheered faintly, and in the
next room, where the older people were
having their supper, there was a hurried
consultation. Then Mrs. Otway
came in.</p>

<p>"What is all this?" she asked, in astonishment,
looking as if she could not
believe her eyes. "Theodore!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>She caught him by the arm, and
dragged him up in a hurry.</p>

<p>"For shame!" she cried. "What a
way to treat your company! I'm going
to put you right straight to bed."</p>

<p>A shudder ran around the room, and
we all looked at one another in horror.
To be put to bed at a party! There was
a disgrace.</p>

<p>"I don't care," Theodore retorted,
recklessly, with tears in his eyes. "I'd
do it again any day. He's a greedy
pig!"</p>

<p>I stole up and slipped my hand in
his. Somehow I did not like to see him
cry.</p>

<p>"He was eating that little girl's
supper," a chorus of eager little boys
explained. "He was eating it all
up!"</p>

<p>"I wasn't either," the stout boy declared,
hastily. "I was only pretending."
He dusted off his knees, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
looked around the incredulous circle. "I
tell you I was only pretending. I
was going to bring it to her all right
afterwards."</p>

<p>Nobody believed him, not even I, for
had I not seen him eating the pink
ice-cream?</p>

<p>"You had better come with me,"
Mrs. Otway said, laughingly. "Come.
You can finish your supper in the next
room."</p>

<p>It was very pleasant after she had
taken him away. Every one was so good
to me. There were lots of nice things
left on the table, and Theodore filled the
largest plate that he could find. Other
little boys stood around to watch me eat,
and gave me presents. One gave me his
jackknife, and one gave me a penny
which he had brightened to gold by rubbing
it on the carpet. When we went
back in the parlor there were dozens and
dozens of little boys who wanted to dance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
with me. I could not tell whom to
choose. Then, in hardly a moment,
Auntie May looked in the door, and I
knew that the party was over, and I must
go home.</p>

<p>I told Theodore good-bye last of
all.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," he said, slipping a little
brass curtain-ring on my left hand.
"I'm coming back when I'm a man.
Then we'll get married, and live in a
house. And I'll shoot rabbits for dinner.
Would you like that?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered, promptly.</p>

<p>He surveyed me for an anxious moment.
Our heads were very nearly on a
level.</p>

<p>"Don't you grow too tall," he
cautioned.</p>

<p>"No," I promised, and was half-way
to the door, when he caught me again by
the hand.</p>

<p>"If anybody makes you cry," he whispered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
ardently, "you write to me, and
I'll come back."</p>

<p>I gave him a grateful smile. I knew
that he would.</p>

<p>Auntie May said very little as the
carriage rolled along, but when, at last,
we reached home, she swept me in before
the assembled family.</p>

<p>"There were ten little boys telling her
good-night," she cried, breathlessly, in a
voice divided between awe and delight.
"Ten little boys! Just fancy! Our
Rhoda! She was a great success. She
was the prettiest one there."</p>

<p>My mother put out a tender hand and
drew me to her.</p>

<p>"And did you have a good time at the
party, Rhoda?" she asked, eagerly.
"A real good time, little girl?"</p>

<p>I looked around the listening family
circle. They were all watching me. Yes,
even my father over his paper.</p>

<p>"I don't know," I answered, bashfully.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course she didn't," grandmother
cried, nodding her head triumphantly.
"Of course she didn't. She's a Harcourt
all over."</p>

<p>I looked down at my little brass ring.
I felt that grandmother was wrong.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>AUNTIE MAY</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/trim.png" width="500" height="20" alt="Decoration" />
</div>


<div class="unindent1"><span class="smcap">Always</span> when I think of Auntie May,
I remember sunshine, and the wind blowing,
and a lilac bush in purple bloom by
the garden gate. We were standing
there together, very quiet and confidential,
she, tall and slim, and I a little girl
who liked to cling to her hand. We had
on our best white dresses, for it was Sunday,
and her church service was white
and violet, and mine was white and gold.
We had parasols just alike, and we stood
waiting until the first boom rang out
from the big bell in the church tower
far down the street.</div>

<p>"Now we will go," Auntie May said.</p>

<p>She opened the garden gate, and we
passed out, very demurely.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>It was seldom that I went into the big
world; but when I did I enjoyed it so!
The parasols cast a pleasant shade, and
I had a big five-cent piece in my right
hand that meant church, and another
clutched tightly in my left that meant
Sunday school. There were other family
parties to be met on the street, elderly
ladies carrying Bibles, and little girls and
boys walking with careful precision, and
down near where the big bell boomed
there was another church which commenced
after ours did where Burton Raymond
played the violin. I could not remember
when I had not known Burton
Raymond and his violin, for they were
one person.</p>

<p>"When Burton Raymond goes to
bed," I had heard my mother say, "he always
puts the violin to bed, too."</p>

<p>"In a bed, mother?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"No. In a box by his bed, wrapped
in his pocket handkerchief, poor fellow."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>It was after this time that Auntie May
embroidered an oddly shaped velvet mat
quite secretly. It had forget-me-nots on
it, and when it was finished she tied it
up in a beautiful white paper, and slipped
it in the mail box down at the corner.
And, once, months afterwards, when
Burton Raymond played one evening at
our house, he put his violin to bed in a
velvet jacket just like the one which
Auntie May had made.</p>

<p>We were great friends. When we met
down by the church steps he would call
to me, cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Rhoda."</p>

<p>"There he is, Auntie May!" I would
cry. "Don't you see him? Look, Auntie
May!"</p>

<p>Somehow, or other, although he never
called to her, I always wanted her to see
him, too.</p>

<p>He looked very pleasant in the bright
sunshine. His hair was nicely brushed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
and his shoes were blacked. There was
a patch on his right elbow; but you
could not see it unless you looked closely.
There was something noble in the way
in which he carried his dark head. Somebody,
perhaps it was Norah, had told me
that one of his ancestors had been a great
lord, back in the days when the lords were
crusaders, and I liked to think of Burton
Raymond in chain armor killing people,
recklessly. Little Dick and I used to act
it out sometimes in the dark end of the
hall. We killed a number of things there,
Saracens, and lions, and tigers, and the
rocking-horse, and little Trixie, and
would come in quite breathless afterwards
to the sitting room where the
family sat in the lamplight. Sometimes
we found them talking about Burton
Raymond.</p>

<p>"Every time that I walk down our
block I seem to meet Burton Raymond,"
my father grumbled, one evening. "It's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
getting to be a nuisance. Especially
since May has been visiting here," he
added, after a serious moment's pause.</p>

<p>"He passed the house fifteen times to-day,"
my mother said, quietly.</p>

<p>She said it with a blush, and then, suddenly,
she made an impulsive dive at my
father's hand and squeezed it.</p>

<p>"We were young ourselves once!"
she cried.</p>

<p>"The lad hasn't a cent to bless himself
with," grandmother demurred.</p>

<p>"But he has genius!" my mother cried
again. "There is a great future opening
before him. And when we were married
we had very little, Robert. There was
just one small twenty-five cent piece left
after the wedding trip. Do you remember,
Robert? And you spent it in
flowers&mdash;for me! They were roses. I
have some of them dried yet."</p>

<p>My mother's voice had sunk lower and
lower, falling almost into a whisper, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
it always did when she was greatly
moved. Sometimes I used to fancy that
my mother was not so clever as my father.
He could add up sums for you, and tell
you about the presidents, and who were
the greatest generals in the world; but
my mother knew quite different things,
the kind that stay with you forever. To
her life was a poem and a dream. She
was her happiest when she could help
somebody, so that for any one to be poor,
and very unfortunate, was an open
sesame to her heart.</p>

<p>I heard a good deal about Burton
Raymond that night, and when I went
to bed I asked a sudden question, staring
with wide open eyes at my mother over
the white coverlet.</p>

<p>"Mother, how poor is Burton Raymond?"</p>

<p>She was taking away the light; but
she came back again.</p>

<p>"He is so poor," she said, dramatically,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
"that he lives in a garret room at
Widow Denton's. It is quite a cold
room, without a fire, and the bed is not
soft like yours, Rhoda. He has a few
books on the end of the shelf by his violin
box. He plays whenever he can get a
chance. Sometimes, perhaps, he is hungry!
Yes, sometimes he is hungry!"</p>

<p>I shivered.</p>

<p>"But it's no sin to be poor, is it,
mother?" I demanded, anxiously. "We
can love people who are poor?"</p>

<p>She put down the light on the bureau
before she answered me.</p>

<p>"Money never bought the real things
of life," she said, slowly. "To be good
and true is the greatest of all. It is sincerity
that counts. And when we see
some one very noble, and very poor, we
must help them, and love them always.
Yes, love them always!"</p>

<p>She gave me a sudden kiss, and took
the lamp away.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>I lay staring into the dark. I could
see that garret room, and the violin on
the shelf, almost I could see Burton
Raymond walking around, very cold and
poor, perhaps; but so lovable, yes, so
lovable, that poverty seemed the very
highest distinction. I made up a long
story about him all by myself. He had
a great fortune left him, and grew into a
lord again, and married Auntie May
long before I went to sleep.</p>

<p>But there was another side to the
picture.</p>

<p>"It's the cheek that himself has to be
coming after our young lady," Norah
declared. "A lad out of a butter and
eggs shop! Is it fitting for the likes of
him to lift his eyes to her?"</p>

<p>"Who, Norah?" I asked, breathlessly.</p>

<p>She was washing clothes with her
sleeves rolled to the elbow. First her
hands went down into the water with a
rush, and then they came up again, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
she rubbed something white on a board,
amid a snowy froth of suds that was good
to look upon. Norah was an authority
on washing, and she was, also, an authority
on love. Sometimes she would toss
back the stray locks from her face, and
sing as she scrubbed with a na&iuml;ve abandon
that would bring grandmother to
the scene in a hurry:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"I'm jist siventeen,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And I've niver had a beau."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Norah sang at the top of her strong
voice accenting each line with great
enjoyment.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Is there any gint will have me?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Ah, don't say no!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>The last phrase was coaxing in the
extreme, and I might have been properly
impressed if I had not known that Norah
was quite old, twenty-five almost, and
that down in the very bottom of her
trunk there was the picture of a wild Irish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
lad whom she had loved and left in the
old country. Sometimes I used to dream
that he would come to America, too, and
get rich notwithstanding his wildness, and
find Norah out, and, just suppose, he
might make a great lady out of her!
Life was full of such glorious possibilities
in those days!</p>

<p>But to go back to the story.</p>

<p>"Why it's Burton Raymond," Norah
explained, in disconnected jerks. "And
his uncle keeps the shop. A small, dark
shop with eggs in the window. And
there's mice under the counter, the
freshest mice that I've iver seen. It's
like household pets that they be! And
Burton waits on the customers. And
at night he fiddles to himself. But
there's no money in fiddling. Sure I
knew a lad in Ireland wance that fiddled
for tuppence a night. And he died of
starvation, and wint to glory, rest be to
his sowl."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>She stopped to hold up a small wet
garment with indignant hands.</p>

<p>"How did you iver git them black
stains?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"I don't know, Norah," I answered,
meekly.</p>

<p>After that I was divided in spirit about
Burton Raymond. There was the part
of me that gloried in the crusader, and
even found something romantic in starvation,
and the other part that winced at
the butter and eggs shop.</p>

<p>The lovers were very pretty to watch.
Burton Raymond went up and down our
street a great many times every day,
and Auntie May always seemed to be out
in the garden looking at the flowers.
She was growing tall herself, like one
of the plants. All her soft hair was
gathered upon the top of her head, and
she never ran about as she used to do.
She had forgotten how to be a little
girl. She changed her dress a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
many times a day, and she bought a
band of velvet ribbon to wear around
her throat, and sometimes she would
catch me in a dark corner, and hug me,
rapturously.</p>

<p>"The saints preserve me from iver
being in love!" Norah cried, shaking her
head. "What will the owld gintlemin
say? And the owld lady?"</p>

<p>The old gentleman was my granddad
Lawrence, who lived around the corner
in a big house that outshone ours as the
sun does the moon. There were more
flowers there and more trees, and a fat
horse in the stable that drew a little dog-cart
about the streets of our town, and
best of all there was a fountain in the
garden, where two little iron boys stood
under an iron umbrella, and watched the
birds that came to take their baths in the
pool at their feet. Just now, however, the
house was all closed up, granddad and
grandmother were away, the fountain in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
the garden was quite choked and dusty,
and the birds had found another place to
bathe.</p>

<p>Grandmother Lawrence was my
worldly grandmother, and when she
was at home we tried to live in as
good style as possible that she might
be pleased with us. Always it had been
a sorrow to her that my mother had
married a poor man, and she was quite
resolved that no such catastrophe should
happen to Auntie May.</p>

<p>"I would rather see May dead," I
have heard her declare dramatically,
"yes, dead at my feet, than married to a
poor man!"</p>

<p>She never said this when my father
was around; but he knew as well as the
rest of us that Auntie May was destined
for great things.</p>

<p>She was so pretty, Auntie May was.
Sometimes she let me stay in her room
when she did her hair before the glass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
and I would handle its soft lengths
fondly.</p>

<p>"Auntie May," I asked once, peeping
over her shoulder into the mirror, "may
I be your bridesmaid?"</p>

<p>First she flushed up and laughed, and
then she leaned back in the chair, and
gazed at me, wretchedly.</p>

<p>"Rhoda," she said, "I am the most
miserable girl in the whole world!"</p>

<p>That was the day that grandmother
and granddad Lawrence came home,
and there was a stir all through their
big house and our little one, and Auntie
May was back in her own room, surrounded
by all the pretty things that
were particularly hers. She looked
around it, consideringly. There were
roses on the carpet, and roses on the big
arm-chairs, and roses climbed up the
walls and fell in festoons about the ceiling.
There was a white fur rug in front
of the fire-place, and a silver glitter on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
the bureau. Auntie May looked at it
all in quite a discontented fashion.</p>

<p>"I like things plainer," she said,
plaintively.</p>

<p>Her lip trembled.</p>

<p>"I'd like a garret&mdash;and bare floors&mdash;and
music!" she cried.</p>

<p>"What is that about music?" grandmother
Lawrence questioned, coming in
the door.</p>

<p>She had a string of pearls in her
hand, and she fastened it around Auntie
May's throat as she spoke. It was a
present brought from abroad.</p>

<p>"There, child," she said, not unkindly,
"wear your pearls and be happy, and
don't let us have any more of this
nonsense."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" Auntie May exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes, nonsense," grandmother Lawrence
repeated, coldly.</p>

<p>Auntie May's eyes flashed.</p>

<p>"Do you think you can pay me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
give him up?" she asked, in growing
indignation. "Do you think that I care
about pearls? Do you think that I care
about anything&mdash;but just him?"</p>

<p>She had risen to her feet, and was confronting
grandmother.</p>

<p>"Let me be happy in my own way,"
she pleaded, with soft appeal. "Mother,
let me be happy!"</p>

<p>I thought that for just a moment
grandmother weakened; but it was only
for a moment.</p>

<p>"Happy with a beggar!" she retorted.
"Never!"</p>

<p>The pearls went down on the floor in a
sudden shower.</p>

<p>"Then I'll never be happy in all my
life!" Auntie May answered, in a broken
voice.</p>

<p>After that it seemed as if there was a
heavy cloud over the whole family. We
were none of us as cheerful as we used to
be, not one, and people spoke in whispers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
as they do when some one is very sick.
And Auntie May cried! She cried until
her pretty eyes were red, and all her soft
hair was tousled and damp from much
mourning. And my mother cried with
her. It was a terrible time.</p>

<p>We children had talked the matter
over among ourselves, and we all sided
with Auntie May. Every night little
Dick prayed an extra clause to his long
prayer. It came right after the place
where he prayed for puppies.</p>

<p>"Please, God, let me have two puppies,"
he asked, in a loud, decided tone.
"One brown one, and one white one
with brown spots and a brown tail. And,
please, God, bless Auntie May, and send
her a new beau."</p>

<p>One night he made another announcement.</p>

<p>"Please, God, you needn't bother
about Auntie May's beau. When I
grow up I'll marry her myself."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>"You shan't!" little Trixie cried,
in sudden wrath, from the next crib.
"When I grow up I'm going to marry
her <i>myself</i>."</p>

<p>She bounced in her bed.</p>

<p>Dick answered her from his knees.
He looked like an angel as he knelt there
in his nightgown, with his fair curls falling
about his flushed face.</p>

<p>"Girls can't marry girls," he explained,
scornfully.</p>

<p>"They can!" Trixie screamed.</p>

<p>"They can't!" Dick roared.</p>

<p>He picked up one of his little shoes by
the side of the bed, and threw it at Trixie.
There was an immediate wail from the
next crib. Dick was always a good shot.</p>

<p>"Oh, children, children!" my mother
cried, in despair. "Dick, go to sleep this
moment. Trixie, Trixie, dear, you are
not really hurt."</p>

<p>"But her feelings are, mother," I
protested.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>I knew that the littlest things hurt
just as much as the big.</p>

<p>My mother settled down, disconsolately,
in her rocking chair, with a small,
weeping burden in her arms, and rocked
and sang.</p>

<p>"This is a dreadful family," she said,
in between verses. "There is always a
fuss."</p>

<p>As for Dick he made one more triumphant
discovery before he finally subsided
for the night.</p>

<p>"Girls are soft things," he declared,
jealously, from his crib. "They are!
They are!"</p>

<p>"Dick!" my father called from downstairs,
"you stop that!"</p>

<p>Which settled the subject for the time
being.</p>

<p>There was just one person in the
family who was not upset, and that was
my grandmother Harcourt. She read
her Bible as usual, and watched us with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
grave eyes. She watched grandmother
Lawrence buying pretty dresses by the
dozen for Auntie May, and scolding violently,
because they were not worn, and
she watched granddad going about, with
a perplexed face and a heavy heart, and
even my own father laboriously concocting
funny stories at which nobody
laughed. When grandmother spoke her
remarks were oracular.</p>

<p>"Those whom God hath joined together
let no man put asunder," she said,
with dignity.</p>

<p>And one day when things were at their
very worst, and Auntie May had come to
our house, "to cry in peace," as she said,
grandmother Harcourt laid a small
white note in her hand.</p>

<p>"Go out in the garden, dear," she said,
impressively. "Behind the lilac bush.
Quick!"</p>

<p>Away flew Auntie May, and I after
her.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>Now behind the lilac bush was my own
particular domain. It was where I made
my little mudpies in beautiful clam shells,
and once I had had a caterpillar colony
there, all pretty brown and yellow ones,
and some few with neat tufted backs and
red whiskers. And Jeremiah John, the
wandering turtle, lived there. But no
grown-up person ever ventured behind
the lilac bush, so it was a surprise to find
Burton Raymond, with cobwebs on his
coat and a pale face, waiting for us.</p>

<p>"You!" Auntie May cried.</p>

<p>She said it almost in a shriek. She
put her arms about him and clung to
him.</p>

<p>"You!" she said again, with infinite
content.</p>

<p>They didn't appear to mind me in the
least, and they nearly killed Jeremiah
John, who had gone to sleep in the sun.</p>

<p>Burton Raymond had seemed frightened
at first; but when he saw how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Auntie May cried and clung to him, his
head went up, and his eyes grew dark,
and he looked every inch a crusader.
They talked together in whispers. He
was persuading her to do something.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no!" she cried.</p>

<p>She looked down at her clothes.</p>

<p>"What! In this dress!" she exclaimed,
hotly.</p>

<p>He whispered again, and little by little
she stopped shaking her head, and grew
a trifle rosy and confused, and, at last,
it seemed to me that she said, "yes." It
must have been something very terrible
to which she had agreed, for she faltered
afterwards, and had to be encouraged
some more. Then she picked a bunch
of the lilacs and pinned it in her belt,
and they went on toward the gate together.
Her hand was on the latch
before she remembered me.</p>

<p>"Oh, there's Rhoda!" she said.</p>

<p>Her eyes questioned mine, anxiously.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>"Will you come, too, Rhoda?" she
asked.</p>

<p>Somehow I felt that she would be glad
to have one of the family with her, so I
went.</p>

<p>Of course I knew that it was an elopement.
Auntie May was running away,
just like a princess in a fairy tale! I
knew whole pages and pages of fairy
tales, and I had always liked the ones
best where the princess ran away; but
I had never expected to be in a fairy
tale myself. The sun was so bright,
and the air was golden with mystery.
The gate shut with a soft click. I felt
that it would never betray us. It was
very exciting afterwards. We turned
around a corner, and there was a horse
and buggy waiting for us in quite a
magical fashion, and in a moment we
were in and off.</p>

<p>"Oh, make him go fast, Burton,"
Auntie May prayed.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>She was frightened again.</p>

<p>"Oh, make him go very fast!" she
cried.</p>

<p>The houses whisked past us. The
people in the streets looked at us,
strangely, and one old man, a lifelong
friend of my grandfather's, ran out to
the curb, and held up his cane, imperatively,
for us to stop. On we went, with
a clatter and a bounce, right through the
town, and out into the quiet country
beyond, where there were daisies in the
fields, and cows to regard us with astonishment,
and dogs to bark as we
went along. We were all quite pale
by now, I fancy, and wild-eyed. At
least the prince and the princess were,
and they held hands as if they had been
lost and had found each other. And,
then, away off in the distance I saw the
steeple of a tiny church. It grew taller
and taller.</p>

<p>Always when I had thought of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Auntie May's bridesmaid, I had expected
to wear a white dress and carry
flowers, and walk right down the aisle
with all the golden and red and blue
ladies in the church windows watching
me; but now when the time came I concluded
that I liked this new way best of
all. The minister was out in his front
yard when we drove up, and I thought
that he looked at our bridal party rather
pityingly. And I also thought that he
considered us a joke. We walked up to
him trembling, and stood about the bed
which he was digging.</p>

<p>"We'd like to be married, sir,"
Burton announced, awkwardly.</p>

<p>The minister regarded us all through
big, benevolent, silver-rimmed spectacles.
He left off his digging to smile at us.
He had a geranium in one hand, and a
shovel in the other.</p>

<p>"I thought you were a christening
party," he said.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>He pointed his shovel at me.</p>

<p>"Who's that?" he demanded, beaming.</p>

<p>"I'm the bridesmaid," I told him.</p>

<p>Then I felt a sudden confidence in him.
I pulled at his sleeve.</p>

<p>"They're running away," I confided,
anxiously. "Won't you marry them?
If you don't poor Auntie May will never
be married at all!"</p>

<p>"We've only got a few moments'
start, sir," Burton explained, breathlessly.
"There's a carriage after us.
Listen!"</p>

<p>Far in the direction of town we could
hear the sound of coming wheels. While
we listened they seemed to redouble their
speed.</p>

<p>"Oh, if you'd please hurry, sir!"
Auntie May begged, in a panic.
"They'll take me home again! I know
they will. Oh, what shall I do! What
shall I do!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>She looked about with wild eyes as
though for somewhere to hide.</p>

<p>The minister himself seemed to catch
fire a bit at that, and he did hurry.
He had us all in the parsonage parlor
in a moment, and went off upstairs
calling for "Dora." He was back
again immediately in his surplice, with
his wife following him, and there,
standing before a sunny window, the
wilted lilacs still pinned in her belt,
Auntie May became Mrs. Burton
Raymond.</p>

<p>She looked so pretty! Her eyes were
full of tears, and her cheeks were pink.
She trembled a little still from agitation.
After it was all over she turned to Burton,
and held out her hands to him in a
frightened way.</p>

<p>"You'll be good to me?" she
questioned.</p>

<p>"Good!" Burton cried, with his arms
about her.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>He looked as if he could dare the
whole world in her defense.</p>

<p>"If he isn't he'll have to answer to
me," the minister declared, stoutly.</p>

<p>"And to me!" another voice cried,
irately, and there was granddad Lawrence
stalking, unexpectedly, into the
room.</p>

<p>He was very much out of breath, and
very angry. I don't believe that I ever
saw granddad Lawrence so angry before.
For one moment I thought that
he was going to shake Burton; but after
a bit he calmed down, and we all went
home together, the bridal couple in their
buggy in advance, and granddad and I
behind in the dog-cart. Granddad
seemed very sorrowful, and, at last, he
unburdened his mind to me.</p>

<p>"This is all very well, Rhoda," he said,
in a rueful fashion. "But who's going to
break the news to your grandmother!"</p>

<p>He took off his hat, and rumpled up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
his gray hair until it stood up like quills
all over his head.</p>

<p>"Who's going to tell <i>her?</i>" he asked,
blankly.</p>

<p>It worried us both all the way home;
but the question was settled in quite an
unexpected manner, for it was grandmother
Harcourt who went to tell grandmother
Lawrence. She put on her best
black silk, and her lace veil, and her
cameo pin, and she held up her head
very high in the air as she went out of
the front gate.</p>

<p>"I shall tell her a few wholesome
truths," she said, determinedly. "I shall
speak as woman to woman."</p>

<p>"It is really not so bad after all,"
my father told my mother. "They talk
of a concert tour for the boy, and he
comes of a good old family, if it <i>has</i> fallen
on evil times."</p>

<p>He paused for a moment, his eyes
searching the future.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>"And if your father runs for mayor&mdash;I
don't say that he will, but if he
should be persuaded to run&mdash;why, that
story would bring him in a great many
votes. It's so pretty and romantic. All
the world loves a lover you know."</p>

<p>My mother sighed blissfully, and motioned
to him to peep in the parlor door.</p>

<p>There in the darkest corner sat Auntie
May and Burton Raymond on a sofa
together. They sat and looked at each
other for hours and hours and hours.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<div class="unindent1">"<span class="smcap">Of</span> all the childer I've iver seen he's
the worst," Norah cried. "He's as
sharp as tacks, and as bad as a young
magpie."</div>

<p>She had come into the sitting room,
and stood regarding my mother at her
sewing.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Norah?" my
mother demanded, anxiously.</p>

<p>"It's Dick, ma'am. What else
should it be? Ain't I been after making
a grand gingerbread for your
lunch? And ain't he under your own
bed this bless&egrave;d moment?"</p>

<p>She paused for breath, almost crying,
and wringing her hands.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>"He's eating the whole of it!" she
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"What, a whole gingerbread?" my
mother repeated, evidently startled.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am. I've been poking
at him with a broom; but it's no
use."</p>

<p>There was a quick procession up to
my mother's room, my mother leading
it, with her head thrown up in wrath,
then little Trixie and I hand-in-hand,
and Norah following behind us to see
justice done. The room was dark and
orderly; but there was a curious shuffling
sound under the bed.</p>

<p>"Dick!" my mother cried. "Come
out of there! Dick! Do you hear what
I say? Richard!"</p>

<p>When my mother said "Richard"
things were apt to be pretty serious.</p>

<p>Little Dick crawled out from under
the bed very reluctantly. He was red
and sticky; but he had a happy expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
as if he had been having rather
a good time. He brought a tin plate
with him, and it was quite empty.
There was not even so much as a crumb
in it. My mother looked at him in
horror, and grandmother, who had been
attracted by the noise, looked at him,
too, over my mother's shoulder, with
strong disapprobation.</p>

<p>"If he were my son," she said, distinctly,
"I'd give him a good thrashing.
He richly deserves it."</p>

<p>It was a dreadful moment. Little
Trixie and I stared at the scene fascinated,
while my mother wavered between
justice and mercy. When she
finally spoke her voice was very cold
and severe.</p>

<p>"I don't know what I ever did to
have such a son," she said. "After
this I am not going to be his mother
any longer. I shall call him Master
Richard, as if he were a stranger, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
he shall call me Mrs. Harcourt. Nothing
else."</p>

<p>Trixie and I held each other closer.
It was a terrible sentence. To be a
stranger in one's own home! And not
to have any mother! Little Dick's red,
childish cheeks paled, and he looked
frightened. He made a hurried movement
forward, and caught hold of my
mother's dress.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother!" he cried, beseechingly.</p>

<p>"Go away, Master Richard," she
commanded. "I am not your mother."</p>

<p>"Oh, please, Mrs. Harcourt," Dick
wailed. "Oh, please, Mrs. Harcourt,
let me call you mother!"</p>

<p>But my mother was inexorable. She
pushed away his hands, and walked out
of the room, leaving him behind. They
all went away, she, and grandmother,
and Norah, and even little Trixie. I
was the only one who remained.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>I was very sorry for Dick, and I
wanted to hug him badly. But I did
not quite dare. Dick never liked anybody
to hug him, and it was very seldom
that he cried. He dug his fists into his
eyes for a moment, and then he took
them away, and looked at me, gloomily.</p>

<p>"All right," he said. "If she ain't
my mother I ain't her little boy!"</p>

<p>Then he walked into the next room
which was his own, and went down into
the bottom bureau drawer, and got out
a box with a red lining. In it was his
Waterbury watch. That was the most
valuable thing that Dick possessed. He
always took it to bed with him at night,
and he wound it up in the mornings,
and sometimes, when he didn't mean
to play very hard, sometimes he wore
it. He put it on now, and he put two
clean handkerchiefs in his pocket, and
his knife, and a red ball, and the knob
off the machine drawer, and two rubber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
bands, and a wish-bone, and the little
box out of a doll that makes her cry,
and the stopper of a cologne bottle.
And he opened his missionary box,
and fished out ten pennies,&mdash;the ones
which he was saving to educate a native
child in India. When I saw that
I knew that things were very serious.
I went up close to him and touched
him.</p>

<p>"Dick," I said. "Dick! What are
you going to do? Oh, Dick!"</p>

<p>I said it timidly, for although little
brother Dick was only six, and I was
nine, he was nearly as big as I was.
And he was always masterful. But he
didn't repulse me this time, so I kissed
him on his ear, and rubbed my head
against his shoulder, just to let him
know that I loved him. Somehow I
thought that he would like to be loved
just then. And wonder of wonders he
rubbed back!</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>"When I come home&mdash;" Dick said.
"When I'm a rich man, sister, I'll buy
you some nice things. I'll buy you
some candy, and a pretty dress. And
I'll buy you some guinea-pigs! I guess
you'd like to have some guinea-pigs,
wouldn't you, sister?"</p>

<p>I didn't care a rap for guinea-pigs,
but I nodded at him just to comfort
him. I felt that I should like an elephant
if Dick bought it.</p>

<p>"And we'll build a nice house for
them in the backyard," Dick went on,
evidently cheering up at the prospect.
"Under the walnut-tree. And there'll
be fathers and mothers and sisters and
brothers, and little weany, weany ones,
all white and pink!"</p>

<p>"But where are you going, Dick?"
I demanded.</p>

<p>His face fell.</p>

<p>"I'm going through the Green Door,"
he said, doggedly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh!" I breathed, in alarm.</p>

<p>Now there was a long, high fence
behind our house where the morning-glory
vines climbed up and still up, and
then fell in beautiful showers of purple
and pink blossoms, and just in the very
center of the fence where the vines were
the thinnest there was a door,&mdash;a bright,
green door, with a massive lock, and a
huge key, and two great iron hinges.
None of us children knew what lay on
the other side; but there was something
secret-looking about that door, as if it
might lead into Bluebeard's house, or
out into fairy lanes and meadows.
Once, a good while ago, little Dick had
climbed up to the top and looked over.
Then he came down again in a scramble.</p>

<p>"What did you see, brother?" I
quavered.</p>

<p>"The black people!" he replied, in
a whisper.</p>

<p>He caught hold of my apron, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
we both stood listening. It seemed to
me that I could hear some one singing
in the distance, a queer, elfish sort of
a song, and once a step passed along
outside the gate,&mdash;a loitering step.</p>

<p>"Run, sister, run!" Dick cried.</p>

<p>He caught me by the hand in sudden
panic, and we both fled back to the
house together, and we never went near
the Green Door for whole days and
days.</p>

<p>I remembered all this now, and I felt
sorry for Dick. I think that Dick felt
sorry for himself, for he looked around
the bedroom almost wistfully when he
went away. And he didn't slide down
the banisters as he usually did, but
walked downstairs, step by step, very
slowly, and paused by the sitting room
door. My mother was talking inside in
quite a happy fashion. There was the
buzz of the sewing-machine, and a murmur
of conversation between her and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
grandmother, and once when she came
to the end of a seam, once the machine
stopped, and my mother laughed. When
Dick heard that he went on down the
hall with his head up; but he came to
a halt in the dark corner to hug the
hobby-horse, and he cut off a bit of its
white mane, and put the piece carefully
away in his pocket. Dick was always
very fond of the hobby-horse.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, old fellow, good-bye,"
he said. "Don't forget me, Alcibiades."</p>

<p>Alcibiades pranced a little, but he did
not say anything.</p>

<p>I was the one who spoke. I had been
feeling pretty bad for sometime; but
now I couldn't stand it any longer. To
see dear little brother Dick go out into
the world alone! Never to have any
brother any more! I threw my arms
about him from the other side of the
hobby-horse.</p>

<p>"Dick," I cried, tearfully. "Oh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
please, Dick, don't go away! Take me
with you, won't you, Dick?"</p>

<p>"Will you go, too, sister?" Dick demanded,
eagerly.</p>

<p>I nodded at him.</p>

<p>"We won't never come back," he
cautioned.</p>

<p>I stole a look down the hall, the dear,
familiar hall.</p>

<p>"All right, Dick," I said, with a gulp.</p>

<p>Nobody noticed us as we slipped down
the path to the Green Door, not even
Norah, who was singing in the kitchen.
The hinges squeaked, and the gate came
open with a rumble. It almost seemed
as if my mother must know! We pulled
it to behind us in a hurry, and stepped
out into the world. We held each other
tight.</p>

<p>It was very different on the other
side of the wall from our side. There
were no flowers there, and no vines.
There was a street with small, mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
houses, and great piles of clam shells,
and a goat or two running about at a
distance, and some very dirty ducks
going home in single file. Away down
the square there was a great red building,
with smoke pouring out of its many
chimneys, and here and there walking
about the street, and standing at the
doors, were the black people&mdash;not black
in any true sense of the word, but
grimed with the smut of those who
labor in iron works.</p>

<p>It was a dreadful place. We stood
outside the gate, flattened against the
fence, looking into the street, and afraid
to venture any farther.</p>

<p>Almost, however, in the first moment
we found a friend. She was quite a
small woman, with an anxious expression,
and she gazed at us in a hungry
way. She had an old plaid shawl drawn
loosely over her head, and a little bundle
of shoe-strings dangled from her hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
She had the prettiest, brightest red
cheeks that I had ever seen, and her
hair was a wonderful yellow color, like
a doll's. But somehow there was something
about her that I did not quite
like.</p>

<p>She had been walking along the
street, but when she saw us she stopped
suddenly.</p>

<p>"How do you do, ma'am?" she said.
"And how do you do, master?"</p>

<p>We clung together a little tighter,
and answered her politely.</p>

<p>"Pretty well, I thank you," we said
in a chorus, just as our mother had
taught us to do to strangers.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you like to take a little
walk with me?" she asked, pleasantly.
"Just a block or two? To see my house?
And my little girl?"</p>

<p>We were not dressed to go visiting.
I had on a brown gingham apron to
play in, and Dick had on one, too, over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
his knickerbockers. I began to tell her
about it, but she cut me short.</p>

<p>"As if that mattered!" she cried.
"My God! And my baby! Come,
dears. Come! My little girl is sick.
It would be a Christian charity to come
to see her."</p>

<p>She looked at us almost beseechingly.</p>

<p>"Oh, what can I say to get them to
come!" she exclaimed, in a piteous
fashion.</p>

<p>Dick unclasped my hand and went
up to her sturdily.</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid," he said. "I'll go
with you. Come, sister."</p>

<p>Of course if Dick went I had to go,
too, for he was the smaller. I started
with a reluctant step.</p>

<p>"That's the little lady!" the woman
cried, exultingly.</p>

<p>Our way lay down the block, and
then straight away to the right through
a network of dirty lanes where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
houses were crowded together, leaning
up against one another as though for
support. In some places the rain had
dripped from the roofs into sloppy pools
on the ground, and the path was rough
with fallen bricks and mortar. The
woman was very careful of us. She
showed us the cleanest way, and when
the goats came too near she stood in between
them and us, and shooed them
off. And, at last, we came to a house,
old and battered, with very rickety front
steps and windows stuffed with rags;
that was her home.</p>

<p>There was a stout woman going up
the steps with a pail of soapy water in
her hand who stopped to regard us.</p>

<p>"Where did you get them kids,
Becky Dean?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"That's my business," our new friend
cried, fiercely.</p>

<p>She seemed to bristle with rage.</p>

<p>"Well, I hope there's no harm in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
it," the other replied, curtly, continuing
on her way.</p>

<p>We went up and up three flights of
long, shaky steps to a little room under
the eaves. It was very dark there,&mdash;so
dark that at first I did not notice a bed
in a dim corner, and a child lying on
it looking at us with a pair of beautiful
large eyes. She did not say a word,
but just lay and looked and looked.</p>

<p>The woman sat down on the bed, and
gathered the child to her tenderly.</p>

<p>"See what I've brought you," she
said, almost in a whisper, her cheek
pressed close against the cheek of the
child. "See the nice little lady and
gentleman come to play with you.
Come to play with my own little Amy.
Ain't you pleased with your mama,
Amy? Ain't they nice?"</p>

<p>The child lay and looked at us, and,
at last, very slowly, she smiled. Dick
and I were both very bashful, but we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
smiled back at her from where we stood
by the side of the bed. The mother
seemed greatly relieved. She hunted
about under her faded shawl, and
brought out some sticks of candy, the
kind that taste of peppermint, and have
beautiful red streaks that run zigzag
around them. She generously gave each
of us one, and one to the child. We
all sucked in happy unison. But the
child soon tired. The stick of candy
rolled out of her hand, unregarded, and
she lay back upon her mother with a
faint, wailing cry.</p>

<p>"Maybe she could play a game, if
you know one," the mother urged, anxiously.
"Oh, for the love of heaven,
think of a game!"</p>

<p>"I know 'Little Sallie Waters,'"
Dick declared, speaking for the first
time.</p>

<p>So Dick and I played "Little Sallie
Waters" together. It was hard work,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
there being only two of us, but we
went around and around in a solemn
circle, and sang the words earnestly,
and when we came to the lines,</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Rise, Sallie, rise,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Wipe out your eyes,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Fly to the East,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Fly to the West,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Fly to the very one</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That you love best,"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent2'>we both kissed little Amy Dean, and
she smiled at us again from her mother's
arms, where she had been watching us
with her great, mysterious, melancholy
eyes.</div>

<p>"Sure she's better," the woman cried,
in a tone between laughter and tears.
"My own darlint! She's better! She's
better already! They've done her more
good than the doctor. Sure, she was
lonesome for the likes of her own!"</p>

<p>Her face shone. She looked as if
she could hug us both from gratitude.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've got a doll at home whose name
is Amy," I announced, bashfully, trying
to make conversation.</p>

<p>"That you have," the woman agreed,
heartily. "And without doubts you'll
be bringing it for my little girl to see."</p>

<p>"I'll bring her to-morrow," I promised.</p>

<p>"Do you hear that, Amy?" the mother
commented, happily.</p>

<p>"And I've got a horse named Alcibiades,"
Dick added, in his turn. "He's
got red nostrils and a bushy tail. He
prances. Like this."</p>

<p>He gave a spirited portrayal of Alcibiades
all around the room, ending with
a great whinny of delight.</p>

<p>"Would you let wee Amy take a ride
on the pretty horse?" the mother inquired,
persuasively.</p>

<p>"Yes," Dick promised, with eager
gallantry. "Dozens and dozens of
rides."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>"See there now!" the woman exclaimed.
"Won't my Amy have a
grand time playing with the little lady
and gentleman!"</p>

<p>The child seemed pleased. She laid
one little wasted arm about her mother's
neck in a loving way, and stretched out
the other to us. I almost thought that
she tried to speak. Then she settled
back again, and her eyes gazed off far
beyond us, through the roof of the mean
house, higher and higher, perhaps at
greater joys and glories that were to
be hers forever.</p>

<p>The woman caught the little form to
her quickly.</p>

<p>"Sing something else!" she cried,
wildly. "Sing&mdash;"</p>

<p>She hesitated a moment, rocking herself
to and fro on the edge of the bed
with the child in her arms.</p>

<p>"Couldn't you sing a hymn?" she
whispered. "Couldn't you, dears?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>Dick and I knew lots and lots of
hymns. We always learned them on
Sundays to please our grandmother.
We stood closer together, and sang
with full hearts, our voices rising up,
clearly, shrilly, with childish emphasis:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"There's a Home for little children,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Above the bright blue sky,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Where Jesus reigns in glory,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">A Home of peace and joy;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">No home on earth is like it,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Nor can with it compare,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For everyone is happy,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Nor can be happier there."</span><br />
</div>

<p>There was a sound of weeping in the
room, but we sang on, earnestly, line
after line, just as we had played.</p>

<p>Suddenly a hand was laid on each
of our heads, and we looked up to see
an old priest standing by us. He motioned
for us to be silent, and went
on to the corner where the child lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
on the bed with the woman on her knees
beside her, her face buried in the tiny
dress.</p>

<p>"My daughter?" he said, inquiringly.</p>

<p>The pretty gay head came up with a
start. The red cheeks were disfigured
with weeping.</p>

<p>"She's gone, father!" the woman
cried.</p>

<p>She dragged herself around, still on
her knees, and laid her head against his
hand.</p>

<p>"I've tried so hard to be good, father.
Ever since you talked to me I've tried
and I've tried. You know I have. But
it's no use. No use. Everything goes
wrong with me. And now my Amy's
gone!"</p>

<p>She burst into tears again, her words
becoming incoherent from grief, and
sobbed wildly, her head falling back
against the bed.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where did these children come
from?" the priest demanded, sternly.</p>

<p>She explained through her tears.</p>

<p>"I brought them here for Amy to
play with. I thought&mdash; You know
how they all look down on her here,
father. She never had a playmate. I
thought if she were happier, if there were
little friends of her own age about her,
that I might coax her back again, get
her to stay with me for awhile. I saw
the two children standing at their gate.
I only borrowed them. Sure, I didn't
mean them any harm."</p>

<p>Her voice broke off again into sobs.</p>

<p>It was Dick who created a diversion
at this moment. He had been hunting
through his pockets, and now he brought
out all his precious things,&mdash;the knob
off the machine drawer, the stopper of
the cologne bottle, the ten missionary
cents that were to educate the native
child in India, even the Waterbury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
watch,&mdash;and laid them in a little pile
on the bed. He pulled the old priest's
hand to attract his attention.</p>

<p>"They're for her," he explained,
with a nod at the bed.</p>

<p>He half touched the watch, and drew
his hand away again.</p>

<p>"To keep," he persisted, bravely.
"Tell her not to cry. Oh, tell her not
to cry!"</p>

<p>But the woman cried only the harder.</p>

<p>The old priest took us home very
carefully, down the rickety steps, and
through the dirty courts and lanes,
straight to the Green Door. All the
ferocious-looking black men whom we
met stopped to speak to him, and he
ordered them about, with an air of authority,
like so many small children.
On the way he asked us many questions,
and I confided the whole story to him,
of how little brother Dick had been
naughty, and had eaten the gingerbread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
and had been disowned, and how
we had started out into the wide world
together. Somehow I was glad that
we hadn't gone any farther. Somehow
home seemed a nicer place now. It
was so quiet and so safe, with pleasant
rooms, and a peaceful, sunny garden,
and white, comfortable beds, where we
slept through the long nights, and kind
faces to smile on us, and love to surround
us always. I cried a little as I
told him about it.</p>

<p>"There is only one home, and one
father and mother," the old priest said,
seriously. "Remember that. And be
good children. The holy grace of God
be upon you, my dears."</p>

<p>His kind hands hovered over our heads
for a moment.</p>

<p>He took us back into the yard, and
locked the Green Door himself, and
went into the house to see my mother.
He stayed a long, long while.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>Afterwards my mother came out into
the garden, and kissed us both, with all
her old affection. Her face was very
gentle, as if she, too, had been crying.</p>

<p>"Where is my little son?" she asked,
breathlessly.</p>

<p>But she had her arms around me as
well as around Dick.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

</div>


<div class="unindent1"><span class="smcap">Close</span> in a sheltered corner in our parlor
there stood a bookcase. It had two glass
doors, and a brass key, and rows and
rows of books that looked out invitingly
on the world, and seemed to say, "Come,
read me." On the bottom shelf of all
there were children's books,&mdash;"The
Child's History of England," "Plutarch's
Lives" in brown and gold, a
green "Ivanhoe," a red "Alice in Wonderland,"
and a fat blue book, "The
Child's Own Book of Fairy Tales," with
rubbed corners, and loose leaves, and a
crooked signature on the front page
that read, painstakingly, "Rhoda Harcourt."
These were my books, my dear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
dear books, and with them comes a
memory of hours spent in a window-seat,
of dusky evenings when the firelight
lit an absorbing page, and of
elderly comment heard over my head.</div>

<p>"How she reads!" my father said,
enviously. "I was just like that when
I was a boy."</p>

<p>"The child will have no eyes," my
grandmother complained.</p>

<p>"She must know them by heart," my
mother added.</p>

<p>I did know them pretty thoroughly,
but when I tired of old friends I had
only to climb up a shelf higher to find
new ones. "Japheth in Search of a
Father," "The Mill on the Floss," and
"Les Miserables," stood just above my
head, and there were stories of children
in all of these,&mdash;the most entrancing
stories that opened a window into a
glorious golden world of ideality and
romance. It was such a wide world!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
People did things there. They lived
and loved, and when they died the
event stamped itself on my mind with
a pathos that made me cry from sheer
pity.</p>

<p>"I wish Rhoda wouldn't read so
many books," my mother said. "She
excites herself over them. She is so
different from other children of her
age!"</p>

<p>She said it half complainingly and
half exultingly. Somehow I knew that
my mother liked me to read, and that
she liked me to be a little different
from other children. Sometimes she
bragged about it in a mild way to
chance callers.</p>

<p>"Rhoda reads the oddest things," I
heard her tell two ladies. "When I was
a little girl I liked to read 'The Wide,
Wide World,' but she likes novels and
histories."</p>

<p>The older visitor glanced at me up in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
my corner. It was "Les Miserables"
that day, I remember, and their talk
played on the surface of my mind while
my heart was busy with Cosette.</p>

<p>"Does she go to school?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No," my mother faltered.</p>

<p>The ladies looked at each other.</p>

<p>"What! At her age! Why, who
teaches her?" they demanded, in a
shocked chorus.</p>

<p>"I do myself&mdash;sometimes," my
mother answered, still falteringly.</p>

<p>"Take my advice," the visitor with the
black eyes said, decisively, "and send
that child to school. Why it's a shame!
It isn't fair to the child."</p>

<p>"When she grows up she will regret
it," the one with the tight mouth added.</p>

<p>"She isn't strong," my mother explained.
"We have kept her at home on
that account; but I suppose, yes, I suppose,
that she ought to go to school."</p>

<p>She looked at me a moment in a worried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
fashion, and then brightened, a trifle
of her old pride returning.</p>

<p>"She has the greatest stock of general
information," she confided, whisperingly.
"She astonishes me sometimes. She
does, indeed."</p>

<p>The two ladies shook their heads.</p>

<p>"I don't approve of children knowing
too much," the one with the black eyes
cried.</p>

<p>"And novels!" the other breathed,
evidently appalled.</p>

<p>After they were gone my mother took
the book out of my hand, and read a page
or two of it in a frightened way. She
smoothed my hair, and looked at me
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Why do you like this book, Rhoda?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"Because it's about a little girl,
mother," I answered.</p>

<p>I crept a little closer to her.</p>

<p>"She hadn't any mother," I explained,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
eagerly. "And a man gave her
a beautiful doll, and one night, just
think, he put a gold coin in her shoe!
She was so surprised! Oh, mother, how
I wish I could have been there! I do!
I do!"</p>

<p>"Is that all, Rhoda?"</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>"I have always been a good mother
to you, haven't I, Rhoda?"</p>

<p>I rubbed my head against her arm,
and kissed her hand.</p>

<p>"At least I've tried to be!" my
mother cried. "And now I am going to
do something that perhaps you won't
like; but you may understand some day,
dear. I am going to put this book back
into the bookcase, and I am going to
lock the door. It is not to be opened
until I give you leave."</p>

<p>"It isn't my fault, is it, mother?" I
asked, perplexed.</p>

<p>"No, it is not your fault. It's only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
that I want to keep my little girl just
the same in heart and mind as she has
always been."</p>

<p>She put the book back on the shelf,
and she locked the door; but she did
not take away the brass key. She knew
and I knew that I would never touch
it.</p>

<p>But, oh, how I longed for my dear
books! I used to creep to the door and
look in at them, and it seemed to me that
they appeared lonesome. I finished out
the story of Cosette to suit myself, and I
made stories likewise for the books
which I did not know. There was one
remarkable thing about my stories, and
that was that nobody ever died; but they
all lived happy forever and ever. Even
when my mother read the Bible to me on
Sunday nights after I was in bed I used
to sit up anxiously, and pray her to end
the stories in my way.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't let the lions eat poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
Daniel!" I would cry. "Oh, mother,
mother, don't let them eat him up!"</p>

<p>"Why it happened centuries ago,
dear," my mother answered, half
laughing.</p>

<p>"But I can see it," I protested. "I
can see it right now!"</p>

<p>It was so hard to see things going
wrong, and not to be able to help!</p>

<p>It was about this time that my mother
and I did a great many lessons together,
and she would offer me odd bits of useful
information at unexpected moments.</p>

<p>"Rhoda is not very well grounded,"
she told my father, "but I do think,
Robert, that she knows a great deal for
a child of ten."</p>

<p>She was darning stockings as she
spoke, and she turned over a very ragged
one of Dick's with a little sigh.</p>

<p>"I would like her to go to school. Not
to the public school, but to a young
ladies' seminary as I did. Don't you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
think, Robert, if I were to do without
a new winter coat, and we made the old
carpet on the stairs last a little longer,
that we might send Rhoda to Mrs.
Garfield's?"</p>

<p>Her face was brightening as she
thought it out.</p>

<p>"And there's the money in her bank,"
she cried, "her gold pieces that dad has
given her on her birthdays and on Christmas.
I don't suppose, Robert, you'd
want dad to pay for it all? He would,
willingly."</p>

<p>"No," my father answered.</p>

<p>My mother's face fell, and then lit up
again.</p>

<p>"You are a ridiculously proud boy,"
she declared, fondly. "Well, at any
rate, we can save my coat and the
carpet."</p>

<p>I wanted to go to school very badly.
Every day at half past ten there was a
procession past our house of thirty little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
girls walking two and two. They all
looked happy and important, and I
thought how wonderful it might be if I
should join their ranks.</p>

<p>Norah, who was always sympathetic,
read my fortune in a teacup out in the
kitchen that night to see what might be
going to happen.</p>

<p>"There's a change coming to you,"
she said, mysteriously. "There's a fair
woman, a widdy by the looks of her,
and water to cross, and much money.
Sure you'll be gitting so grand that
you'll be forgitting your poor old
Norah."</p>

<p>I put my arms around her to reassure
her.</p>

<p>"I'll never forget you, Norah," I
promised.</p>

<p>"Won't you then?" she cried, much
pleased.</p>

<p>"No. And, Norah, listen! All that
I learn I shall teach you myself!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sure there's a great day coming for
both of us," Norah agreed.</p>

<p>I shall never forget that day, the start
in the early sunshine, the stiff ruffled
apron that I wore, and my mother leading
me along the street by the hand. She
was just as much excited as I was, and
when we came to the door of a large
white house, with a brass plate saying,
"Mrs. Garfield's Select School for Girls
and Young Ladies," she stopped a moment
before she rang the bell to rearrange
my hair, and give me a private
hug.</p>

<p>"Don't forget your seven times!" she
whispered, warningly.</p>

<p>I was too far gone for reply, but I
nodded, blindly, at her through a mist of
tears, unexpected tears, for somehow or
other I suddenly seemed to be leaving
my old life behind me, and to be going
into a strange country.</p>

<p>It was very quiet in the white house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
There were a great many rooms, and a
subdued hum of recitation. A clock in
the hall ticked loudly. My mother and
I sat on two lonely chairs in the reception
room and waited. I remember that
there was a large piece of white coral on
the floor in front of the pierglass. It had
exactly thirty-seven points. And there
was a motto neatly framed on the wall.
"The Good Child Makes the Careful
Mother." By and by there was a rustle
of silk in the doorway, and Mrs. Garfield
was shaking hands with us. She
was a fair, pleasant-looking lady. She
shook hands with my mother first, and
then with me. She gazed at me, very
closely and attentively, much as a doctor
might gaze, but she had kind eyes and
once in awhile her dignity would break
into a smile.</p>

<p>"I want to enter my little girl," my
mother said, falteringly. "She&mdash;she
doesn't know a great deal."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then there's all the more to learn,"
Mrs. Garfield encouraged us, brightly.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that she liked to
know that I didn't know anything. It
seemed to me that she liked to think
that I was to be built up after her own
plan.</p>

<p>She was busy in a moment asking my
age, and getting my school books together.
There was a brief farewell with
my mother in the hall, during which I
clung to her, wildly, then the door had
shut and I was alone in the world. It
was a dreadful feeling to be alone! And
it was still more dreadful when I had
followed Mrs. Garfield into a large room
filled with pupils seated at their desks,
and had been introduced to Miss Lucy,
the teacher in charge.</p>

<p>"A little new friend of ours, Miss
Lucy," Mrs. Garfield said, in the hush
that followed our arrival.</p>

<p>Then she turned and left me.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>An elderly lady shook my hand in welcome.
She had a soft hand, and a worried
look as if something had been going
wrong, and there was a little curly-haired
girl standing in a far corner, with her
face hidden against the wall, who was
sobbing bitterly. Somebody had been
drawing a picture on the blackboard.
It showed a stout man with bow-legs,
and an ugly face, and underneath was
written "Miss Lucy's Beau."</p>

<p>"You can come out of the corner, Miss
Armitage," Miss Lucy said, in an icy
tone.</p>

<p>She pointed an accusing finger at the
blackboard.</p>

<p>"As for that dreadful&mdash;that distinctly
unladylike&mdash;performance of
yours on the blackboard I shall allow it
to remain until the noon recess."</p>

<p>The little girls all looked at one
another.</p>

<p>"Shan't I rub it right off, Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
Lucy?" a small person in a long apron
demanded, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Oh, teacher, teacher, let me rub it
off!" another echoed.</p>

<p>She had bright red hair and a plaid
dress.</p>

<p>"No, Cebelia, no, Janet," Miss Lucy
replied, more in sorrow than in anger.
"We will look at this drawing together.
We will consider its disloyalty, its bad
perspective, one foot is larger than the
other notwithstanding all I have taught
her! its <i>unchristian spirit!</i>"</p>

<p>She paused for a moment, and seemed
to discover me.</p>

<p>"Miss Harcourt, you may take the
seat next to Miss Armitage," she added,
in haste. "Young ladies, we will go on
with the geography lesson."</p>

<p>I followed the little curly-headed girl
to a desk, and sat down, and looked at
her. And she looked back at me with
drowned eyes. She was rather pretty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
Suddenly, somehow, I felt sorry for her,
bad as she evidently was. I slipped my
hand into hers.</p>

<p>"Don't cry!" I whispered, in compassion.
"You dear! Don't cry!"</p>

<p>She pushed up the cover of the desk,
and kissed me in its shadow.</p>

<p>"I like you," she whispered, ardently.</p>

<p>"And I like you," I whispered back.</p>

<p>"Let's be friends," she suggested.</p>

<p>We kissed again, solemnly, in agreement.</p>

<p>Up in front the geography class was
bounding Asia very eagerly and rapidly.
They had all the air of people who had
recently escaped from some great peril.
We did not pay them much attention for
we were too much occupied with each
other. Oh, the glory of having a friend,
the secrets that we confided that morning
behind the desk cover, the horse-hair
rings which we exchanged in token of
undying affection, the dear human delight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
of finding some one who is your
own age, and who loves you!</p>

<p>School lost its terrors for me in a very
short while. With Grace Armitage beside
me I was willing to dare all things,
and when half past ten came I went quite
happily hand-in-hand with her in the
little procession down the sunny street.
It was so odd to look at my home from
the outside, to see Norah hanging out
the wash, the twins playing in the garden,
and even grandmother sewing composedly
at a window, just as if it were
an ordinary day, and I had not gone to
school for the first time. But my mother
remembered, and when we passed the
door she came running out and waved
to me.</p>

<p>After that life resolved itself into a
series of school days. Every morning I
went gayly off with my books, feeling
a new sense of importance, and every
afternoon I came running home, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
budget of news to tell my mother.
There were many things to puzzle me
in the new world. For instance, I could
never understand, why, when the spelling
lesson was particularly hard, Janet
McLarin would always show a great
anxiety to hear about Miss Lucy's
childhood.</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Lucy," she would cry,
clasping her hands together, "tell us
about when you were a little girl!"</p>

<p>Then there would come a perfect
chorus from the whole class.</p>

<p>"Oh, do, Miss Lucy! Do tell us about
when you were a little girl!"</p>

<p>"Tell us about the little cloak your
mother made out of a shawl," Cebelia
would say, invitingly.</p>

<p>Even Grace would add her quota.</p>

<p>"Tell about your mother's party dress,
and how she first met your father."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," the others would clamor.
"And tell us about her pink coral beads,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
and how they were lost, and <i>he</i> found
them!"</p>

<p>Then Miss Lucy would close the green
spelling book, with a gratified smile, and
gather us about her in a little hushed
circle, and tell us the tales of a bygone
age. I liked Miss Lucy. I liked to sit
up close to her and to Grace, and hear
about the party dress, and the pink coral
beads, and when it all ended happily, as
stories should, I would give a great sigh
of satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Dear me," Miss Lucy would say, all
aglow with enthusiasm, "it's time for
recess! Why, where has the morning
gone! Well, girls, you'll have to take
the same lesson over again for to-morrow."</p>

<p>She was very simple minded, Miss
Lucy was, and she understood the
situation just as little as I did myself.</p>

<p>Janet McLarin was Scotch, and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
was canny. She could do every sum
in the arithmetic; but when the day
came for compositions she would put
her bright head down in her lap and
groan.</p>

<p>"I wish I was dead," she would say,
despairingly. "I do! I do!"</p>

<p>Cebelia was more stoical; but she
would fold great pleats in her apron, and
frown at the blackboard. Miss Lucy always
wrote the subjects for the compositions
on the blackboard, one under the
other, beautifully written out for our
decision.</p>

<div class='poem'>
The Story of a Nine-pin.<br />
Thoughts on Spring.<br />
The Triumph of Columbus.<br />
My Mother's Flower Garden.<br />
A Meadow Daisy.<br />
The Beauty of Truth.<br />
</div>

<p>They were lovely, lovely subjects! I
would sit and look at them in a blissful
dream.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>One day, the very first composition
day, I remember Grace gave me a little
shake.</p>

<p>"Which one are you going to take?"
she demanded, dolefully.</p>

<p>"I don't know," I answered, with a
happy smile.</p>

<p>"Girls," Grace cried, "I believe
Rhoda could write them <i>all!</i> She likes
to write!"</p>

<p>Miss Lucy was out of the room, and I
remember that they all came around me,
and looked at me, as if I had been a
strange animal.</p>

<p>"Rhoda," Janet McLarin cried, taking
her head out of her lap, "if you'll
write my composition for me I'll give
you my best blue hair ribbon. My Sunday
one. Honest."</p>

<p>I didn't want the hair ribbon; but I
nodded at her.</p>

<p>"I'll write it," I said.</p>

<p>"Will you write me one, Rhoda,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
dear?" Grace asked, jealously, with her
face against mine. "You are <i>my</i> friend,
not hers."</p>

<p>"I'll write yours, too," I agreed.</p>

<p>"And one for me?"</p>

<p>"And for me?"</p>

<p>I nodded at them, generously.</p>

<p>"I'll write one for everybody," I declared,
with a glow of pleasure.</p>

<p>"But don't tell anyone," Janet
cautioned.</p>

<p>I couldn't understand why she insisted
on making a secret of it. It seemed
so strange. But I promised to tell no
one, not even my own mother.</p>

<p>We always had two days in which to
write our compositions. I did ten in that
time. I wrote them out roughly on
great sheets of wrapping paper. I wrote
them up in the garret by the window
where the wasps lived, and I had such a
grand time that I never noticed the
wasps at all; but went on and on finding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
something new to say every minute, and
loving to say it. Only it was hard when
the sentences happened to come out
beautifully not to be able to show them
to my mother. But I had promised.
However, the very best composition of
all was to be my own, and that I might
show to her. I remember it was on "The
Beauty of Truth."</p>

<p>"It's very nice," my mother said,
when it was put in her hand. "It's&mdash;it's
almost like a sermon!"</p>

<p>She looked at the composition, with an
odd smile of pleasure, and then she drew
me to her and kissed me fondly.</p>

<p>"I think Rhoda would make a fine
wife for a minister," I heard her tell my
father, excitedly. "She's got so much
natural piety!"</p>

<p>I was very happy that morning as I
went to school. I carried my roll of
wrapping paper under my arm, and
when I reached Mrs. Garfield's I divided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
the compositions among the girls, so that
they might each copy her own. Afterwards
they were all handed up to Miss
Lucy and school began.</p>

<p>Miss Lucy took a long time over the
compositions. She read them and read
them. She looked astonished, and, also,
a trifle pleased. At last she gathered
them all up in a bundle, and went out of
the room. It was very quiet in the room.
Every little girl sat at her desk and
studied very busily. All except Janet
McLarin. She opened the side window
and climbed out. The last we could see
of her was her bright hair vanishing
around the corner with a rush. Then we
could hear the sound of Miss Lucy's
stout boots coming along the hall, and a
swish of silk beside her.</p>

<p>"She's bringing Mrs. Garfield!"
Grace whispered, horror-stricken.</p>

<p>Up to that time I had not been frightened,
for there was nothing to be frightened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
about; but fear is contagious, and
somehow I began to be scared myself.</p>

<p>Mrs. Garfield stood up in front of us
with a roll of papers in her hand.</p>

<p>"Young ladies," she began, "I have
something very serious to say to you,
something which it gives me great pain
to say. Your compositions have come in
this morning, and your teacher has been
surprised at them. She has referred the
matter to me. I in my turn have been
surprised."</p>

<p>She paused. The room was very, very
still.</p>

<p>"I find myself driven to the conclusion
that not one of these compositions
has been written by a member of this
class. They have been written by somebody
else. They have been written by
an outsider. I demand to know who has
written them."</p>

<p>I felt very funny inside my breast.
My eyes were full of tears. I looked at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
Mrs. Garfield standing up there, very
severe, and somewhat angry, and at Miss
Lucy beside her, with a bewildered expression.
I looked at rows of pale little
girls at their desks. I looked at Grace.
Oh, it was cruel, cruel! They had
never told me that I was doing wrong.
I had loved them so, and given them
my best, and they had all betrayed me!
Even Grace! Then I thought of "The
Beauty of Truth." I rose up from my
seat.</p>

<p>"I did it, Mrs. Garfield," I confessed,
brokenly. "I wrote them myself."</p>

<p>Then I cried, my heart breaking inside
of me.</p>

<p>There was a rustle at the next desk.</p>

<p>"It isn't Rhoda's fault," Grace's voice
exclaimed. "She wrote them, but we
asked her to. We are all bad, just as
bad as she is. And Janet McLarin who
has gone out of the window is the worst
of us all!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>If fear is contagious, so is confession.
There was a perfect storm of tearful
explanations and excuses. They all told
Mrs. Garfield how it had been done, and
they showed her the wrapping paper.
One little girl offered me a piece of chewing
gum quite openly to comfort me, and
Miss Lucy dried my eyes on her own
pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<p>All that Mrs. Garfield said was,
"Well!"</p>

<p>But she said it with an air of astonishment.</p>

<p>Afterwards she called me into her own
private sanctum, the place where people
went to be scolded, and felt the bumps
on my forehead.</p>

<p>"Child," she said, "you have great
originality. The region of sublimity is
large. So is that of humor. I predict
a future for you. I do, indeed. Do you
understand what I mean?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am," I answered, timidly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>"I mean that some day you will write
greater things than these wrapping
paper compositions. I mean that with
hard work, hard work, mind you, you
may write books. You may become an
<i>authoress!</i>"</p>

<p>She shook hands with me quite seriously
when I went away as though with
an equal. The next moment she called
me back, and kissed me, holding me close
to her silk breast.</p>

<p>"You have talent, dear child," she
said. "I will develop it. I will watch
over you. Some day there will be
books!"</p>

<p>I went home very bewildered, but
very happy. I looked at the worn places
on the stair carpet almost tenderly. I
laid my cheek against my mother's old
winter coat hanging up in the hall. Suppose
the fortune which Norah had read
in the teacup should come true! Suppose
that <i>I</i> should be the one to buy the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
new things, to make soft the narrow life,
to reimburse the dear ones who gave and
gave and never thought of the sacrifice.
Just suppose! It was as if a great white
door had opened before me.</p>
